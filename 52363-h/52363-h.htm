<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> I look back upon a certain hour of my
life it fills me with wonder that I should
have been so peacefully happy. Strange
as it may seem, utter despair is not without its alloy of
joy. The man who daintily picks his way along a
muddy street is anxious lest he soil his polished boots,
or turns up his coat collar to save himself from the
shower that is beginning, eager then to find a shelter;
but let him inadvertently step into a pool, plunging
head over ears into foul water, and after that he has no
more anxiety. Nothing that weather can inflict will
add to his misery, and consequently a ray of happiness
illumines his gloomy horizon. He has reached the
limit; Fate can do no more; and there is a satisfaction
in attaining the ultimate of things. So it was with me
that beautiful day; I had attained my last phase.</p>

<p>I was living in the cheapest of all paper houses, living
as the Japanese themselves do, on a handful of
rice, and learning by experience how very little it requires
to keep body and soul together. But now, when
I had my next meal of rice, it would be at the expense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
of my Japanese host, who was already beginning to
suspect,&mdash;so it seemed to me,&mdash;that I might be unable
to liquidate whatever debt I incurred. He was very polite
about it, but in his twinkling little eyes there lurked
suspicion. I have travelled the whole world over, especially
the East, and I find it the same everywhere.
When a man comes down to his final penny, some
subtle change in his deportment seems to make the
whole world aware of it. But then, again, this supposed
knowledge on the part of the world may have
existed only in my own imagination, as the Christian
Scientists tell us every ill resides in the mind. Perhaps,
after all, my little bowing landlord was not
troubling himself about the payment of the bill, and I
only fancied him uneasy.</p>

<p>If an untravelled person, a lover of beauty, were
sitting in my place on that little elevated veranda, it is
possible the superb view spread out before him might
account for serenity in circumstances which to the ordinary
individual would be most depressing. But the
view was an old companion of mine; goodness knows
I had looked at it often enough when I climbed that
weary hill and gazed upon the town below me, and the
magnificent harbor of Nagasaki spreading beyond.
The water was intensely blue, dotted with shipping of
all nations, from the stately men-of-war to the ocean
tramps and the little coasting schooners. It was an
ever-changing, animated scene; but really I had had
enough of it during all those ineffective months of
struggle in the attempt to earn even the rice and the
poor lodging which I enjoyed.</p>

<div id="if_p002" class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
  <img src="images/p002.jpg" width="360" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“The twinkling eyes of the Emperor fixed themselves
    on Miss Hemster.”</p></div>
  <div class="captionr"><a href="#Page_144"><i>Page 144</i></a>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span></p>

<p>Curiously, it was not of this harbor I was thinking,
but of another in far-distant Europe, that of Boulogne
in the north of France, where I spent a day with my
own yacht before I sailed for America. And it was a
comical thought that brought the harbor of Boulogne
to my mind. I had seen a street car there, labelled
“Le Dernier Sou,” which I translated as meaning
“The Last Cent.” I never took a trip on this street
car, but I presume somewhere in the outskirts of
Boulogne there is a suburb named “The Last Cent,”
and I thought now with a laugh: “Here I am in Japan,
and although I did not take that street car, yet I have
arrived at ‘Le Dernier Sou.’”</p>

<p>This morning I had not gone down to the harbor to
prosecute my search for employment. As with my last
cent, I had apparently given that idea up. There was
no employer needing men to whom I had not applied
time and again, willing to take the laborer’s wage for
the laborer’s work. But all my earlier training had
been by way of making me a gentleman, and the manner
was still upon me in spite of my endeavors to shake
it off, and I had discovered that business men do not
wish gentlemen as day-laborers. There was every
reason that I should be deeply depressed; yet, strange
to say, I was not. Had I at last reached the lotus-eating
content of the vagabond? Was this care-free
condition the serenity of the tramp? Would my next
step downward be the unblushing begging of food,
with the confidence that if I were refused at one place
I should receive at another? With later knowledge,
looking back at that moment of mitigated happiness, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
am forced to believe that it was the effect of coming
events casting their shadows before. Some occultists
tell us that every action that takes place on the earth,
no matter how secretly done, leaves its impression on
some ethereal atmosphere, visible to a clairvoyant, who
can see and describe to us exactly what has taken place.
If this be true, it is possible that our future experiences
may give sub-mental warnings of their approach.</p>

<p>As I sat there in the warm sunlight and looked over
the crowded harbor, I thought of the phrase, “When
my ship comes in.” There was shipping enough in
the bay, and possibly, if I could but have known where,
some friend of mine might at that moment be tramping
a white deck, or sitting in a steamer chair, looking up
at terrace upon terrace of the toy houses among which
I kept my residence. Perhaps my ship had come in
already if only I knew which were she. As I lay back
on the light bamboo chair, along which I had thrown
myself,&mdash;a lounging, easy, half-reclining affair like
those we used to have at college,&mdash;I gazed upon the
lower town and harbor, taking in the vast blue surface
of the bay; and there along the indigo expanse of the
waters, in striking contrast to them, floated a brilliantly
white ship gradually, imperceptibly approaching. The
canvas, spread wing and wing, as it increased in size,
gave it the appearance of a swan swimming toward me,
and I thought lazily:</p>

<p>“It is like a dove coming to tell me that my deluge
of misery is past, and there is an olive-branch of foam
in its beak.”</p>

<p>As the whole ship became visible I saw that it, like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
the canvas, was pure white, and at first I took it for a
large sailing yacht rapidly making Nagasaki before
the gentle breeze that was blowing; but as she drew
near I saw that she was a steamer, whose trim lines,
despite her size, were somewhat unusual in these
waters. If this were indeed a yacht she must be owned
by some man of great wealth, for she undoubtedly cost
a fortune to build and a very large income to maintain.
As she approached the more crowded part of the bay,
her sails were lowered and she came slowly in on her
own momentum. I fancied I heard the rattle of the
chain as her anchor plunged into the water, and now I
noticed with a thrill that made me sit up in my lounging
chair that the flag which flew at her stern was the
Stars and Stripes. It is true that I had little cause to
be grateful to the country which this piece of bunting
represented, for had it not looted me of all I possessed?
Nevertheless in those distant regions an Englishman
regards the United States flag somewhat differently
from that of any nation save his own. Perhaps there
is an unconscious feeling of kinship; perhaps the similarity
of language may account for it, because an
Englishman understands American better than any
other foreign tongue. Be that as it may, the listlessness
departed from me as I gazed upon that banner, as
crude and gaudy as our own, displaying the most striking
of the primary colors. The yacht rested on the
blue waters as gracefully as if she were a large white
waterfowl, and I saw the sampans swarm around her
like a fluffy brood of ducklings.</p>

<p>And now I became conscious that the most polite individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
in the world was making an effort to secure
my attention, yet striving to accomplish his purpose in
the most unobtrusive way. My patient and respected
landlord, Yansan, was making deep obeisances before
me, and he held in his hand a roll which I strongly
suspected to be my overdue bill. I had the merit in
Yansan’s eyes of being able to converse with him in his
own language, and the further advantage to myself of
being able to read it; therefore he bestowed upon me a
respect which he did not accord to all Europeans.</p>

<p>“Ah, Yansan!” I cried to him, taking the bull by
the horns, “I was just thinking of you. I wish you
would be more prompt in presenting your account.
By such delay errors creep into it which I am unable
to correct.”</p>

<p>Yansan awarded me three bows, each lower than the
one preceding it, and, while bending his back, endeavored,
though with some confusion, to conceal the roll
in his wide sleeve. Yansan was possessed of much
shrewdness, and the bill certainly was a long standing
one.</p>

<p>“Your Excellency,” he began, “confers too much
honor on the dirt beneath your feet by mentioning the
trivial sum that is owing. Nevertheless, since it is
your Excellency’s command, I shall at once retire and
prepare the document for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t trouble about that, Yansan,” I said,
“just pull it out of your sleeve and let me look over
it.”</p>

<p>The wrinkled face screwed itself up into a grimace
more like that of a monkey than usual, and so, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
various genuflections, Yansan withdrew the roll and
proffered it to me. Therein, in Japanese characters,
was set down the long array of my numerous debts to
him. Now, in whatever part of the world a man
wishes to delay the payment of a bill, the proper course
is to dispute one or more of its items, and this accordingly
I proceeded to do.</p>

<p>“I grieve to see, Yansan,” I began, putting my finger
on the dishonest hieroglyphic, “that on the fourth
day you have set down against me a repast of rice,
whereas you very well know on that occasion I did myself
the honor to descend into the town and lunch with
his Excellency the Governor.”</p>

<p>Again Yansan lowered his ensign three times, then
deplored the error into which he had fallen, saying it
would be immediately rectified.</p>

<p>“There need to be no undue hurry about the rectification,”
I replied, “for when it comes to a settlement
I shall not be particular about the price of a plate of
rice.”</p>

<p>Yansan was evidently much gratified to hear this,
but I could see that my long delay in liquidating his
account was making it increasingly difficult for him to
subdue his anxiety. The fear of monetary loss was
struggling with his native politeness. Then he used
the formula which is correct the world over.</p>

<p>“Excellency, I am a poor man, and next week have
heavy payments to make to a creditor who will put me
in prison if I produce not the money.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said I grandly, waving my hand toward
the crowded harbor, “my ship has come in where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
you see the white against the blue. To-morrow you
shall be paid.”</p>

<p>Yansan looked eagerly in the direction of my gesture.</p>

<p>“She is English,” he said.</p>

<p>“No, American.”</p>

<p>“It is a war-ship?”</p>

<p>“No, she belongs to a private person, not to the
Government.”</p>

<p>“Ah, he must be a king, then,&mdash;a king of that
country.”</p>

<p>“Not so, Yansan; he is one of many kings, a pork
king, or an oil king or a railroad king.”</p>

<p>“Surely there cannot be but one king in a country,
Excellency,” objected Yansan.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are thinking of a small country like Japan.
One king does for such a country; but America is
larger than many Japans, therefore it has numerous
kings, and here below us is one of them.”</p>

<p>“I should think, Excellency,” said Yansan, “that
they would fight with one another.”</p>

<p>“That they do, and bitterly, too, in a way your kings
never thought of. I myself was grievously wounded
in one of their slightest struggles. That flag which
you see there waves over my fortune. Many a million
of sen pieces which once belonged to me rest secure for
other people under its folds.”</p>

<p>My landlord lifted his hands in amazement at my
immense wealth.</p>

<p>“This, then, is perhaps the treasure-ship bringing
money to your Excellency,” he exclaimed, awestricken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s just what it is, Yansan, and I must go
down and collect it; so bring me a dinner of rice, that
I may be prepared to meet the captain who carries my
fortune.”</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">After</span> a frugal repast I went down the hill to
the lower town, and on inquiry at the custom-house
learned that the yacht was named
the “Michigan,” and that she was owned by Silas K.
Hemster, of Chicago. So far as I could learn, the
owner had not come ashore; therefore I hired a
sampan from a boatman who trusted me. I was already
so deeply in his debt that he was compelled to
carry me, inspired by the optimistic hope that some day
the tide of my fortunes would turn. I believe that commercial
institutions are sometimes helped over a crisis
in the same manner, as they owe so much their creditors
dare not let them sink. Many a time had this lad ferried
me to one steamer after another, until now his
anxiety that I should obtain remunerative employment
was nearly as great as my own.</p>

<p>As we approached the “Michigan” I saw that a
rope ladder hung over the side, and there leaned against
the rail a very free-and-easy sailor in white duck, who
was engaged in squirting tobacco-juice into Nagasaki
Bay. Intuitively I understood that he had sized up
the city of Nagasaki and did not think much of it.
Probably it compared unfavorably with Chicago. The
seaman made no opposition to my mounting the ladder;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
in fact he viewed my efforts with the greatest indifference.
Approaching him, I asked if Mr. Hemster was
aboard, and with a nod of his head toward the after
part of the vessel he said, “That’s him.”</p>

<p>Looking aft, I now noticed a man sitting in a cushioned
cane chair, with his two feet elevated on the spotless
rail before him. He also was clothed in light summer
garb, and had on his head a somewhat disreputable
slouch hat with a very wide brim. His back was toward
Nagasaki, as if he had no interest in the place.
He revolved an unlit cigar in his mouth, in a manner
quite impossible to describe; but as I came to know
him better I found that he never lit his weed, but kept
its further end going round and round in a little circle
by a peculiar motion of his lips. Though he used the
very finest brand of cigars, none ever lasted him for
more than ten minutes, when he would throw it away,
take another, bite off the end, and go through the same
process once more. What satisfaction he got out of an
unlighted cigar I was never able to learn.</p>

<p>His was a thin, keen, business face, with no hair on
it save a tuft at the chin, like the beard of a goat. As
I approached him I saw that he was looking sideways
at me out of the corners of his eyes, but he neither
raised his head nor turned it around. I was somewhat
at a loss how to greet him, but for want of a better
opening I began:</p>

<p>“I am told you are Mr. Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Well!” he drawled slowly, with his cigar between
his teeth, released for a moment from the circular
movement of his lips, “you may thank your stars you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
are told something you can believe in this God-forsaken
land.”</p>

<p>I smiled at this unexpected reply and ventured:</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, the East is not renowned for
its truthfulness. I know it pretty well.”</p>

<p>“You do, eh? Do you understand it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think either an American or a European
ever understands an Asiatic people.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we do,” rejoined Mr. Hemster; “they’re
liars and that’s all there is <em>to</em> them. Liars and lazy;
that sums them up.”</p>

<p>As I was looking for the favor of work, it was not
my place to contradict him, and the confident tone in
which he spoke showed that contradiction would have
availed little. He was evidently one of the men who
knew it all, and success had confirmed him in his belief.
I had met people of his calibre before,&mdash;to my
grief.</p>

<p>“Well, young man, what can I do for you?” he
asked, coming directly to the point.</p>

<p>“I am looking for a job,” I said.</p>

<p>“What’s your line?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p>“What can you do?”</p>

<p>“I am capable of taking charge of this ship as captain,
or of working as a man before the mast.”</p>

<p>“You spread yourself out too thin, my son. A man
who can do everything can do nothing. We specialize
in our country. I hire men who can do only one thing,
and do that thing better than anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I do not agree with you,” I could not help<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
saying. “The most capable people in the world are
the Americans. The best log house I ever saw was
built by a man who owned a brown-stone front on
Fifth Avenue. He simply pushed aside the guides
whose specialty it was to do such things, took the axe
in his own hands, and showed them how it should be
accomplished.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hemster shoved his hat to the back of his head,
and for the first time during our interview looked me
squarely in the face.</p>

<p>“Where was that?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Up in Canada.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, the Fifth Avenue man had probably
come from the backwoods and so knew how to handle
an axe.”</p>

<p>“It’s more than likely,” I admitted.</p>

<p>“What were you doing in Canada?”</p>

<p>“Fishing and shooting.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t one of the guides he pushed aside?”</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>“No, I was one of the two who paid for the guides.”</p>

<p>“Well, to come back to first principles,” continued
Mr. Hemster, “I’ve got a captain who gives me perfect
satisfaction, and he hires the crew. What else
can you do?”</p>

<p>“I am qualified to take a place as engineer if your
present man isn’t equally efficient with the captain;
and I can guarantee to give satisfaction as a stoker,
although I don’t yearn for the job.”</p>

<p>“My present engineer I got in Glasgow,” said Mr.
Hemster; “and as for stokers we have a mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
stoker which answers the purpose reasonably well, although
I have several improvements I am going to
patent as soon as I get home. I believe the Scotchman
I have as engineer is the best in the business. I
wouldn’t interfere with him for the world.”</p>

<p>My heart sank, and I began to fear that Yansan and
the sampan-boy would have to wait longer for their
money. It seemed that it wasn’t my ship that had
come in, after all.</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Hemster,” I said, “I must congratulate
you on being so well suited. I am much
obliged to you for receiving me so patiently without a
letter of introduction on my part, and so I bid you
good-day.”</p>

<p>I turned for the ladder, but Mr. Hemster said, with
more of animation in his tone than he had hitherto
exhibited:</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, sonny; don’t be so hasty. You’ve
asked me a good many questions about the yacht and
the crew, so I should like to put some to you, and who
knows but we may make a deal yet. There’s the galley
and the stewards, and that sort of thing, you know.
Draw up a chair and sit down.”</p>

<p>I did as I was requested. Mr. Hemster threw his
cigar overboard and took out another. Then he held
out the case toward me, saying:</p>

<p>“Do you smoke?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said I, selecting a cigar.</p>

<p>“Have you matches?” he asked, “I never carry
them myself.”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t,” I admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>He pushed a button near him, and a Japanese steward
appeared.</p>

<p>“Bring a box of matches and a bottle of champagne,”
he said.</p>

<p>The steward set a light wicker table at my elbow,
disappeared for a few minutes, and shortly returned
with a bottle of champagne and a box of matches. Did
my eyes deceive me, or was this the most noted brand
in the world, and of the vintage of ’78? It seemed too
good to be true.</p>

<p>“Would you like a sandwich or two with that wine,
or is it too soon after lunch?”</p>

<p>“I could do with a few sandwiches,” I confessed,
thinking of Yansan’s frugal fare; and shortly after
there were placed before me, on a dainty, white, linen-and-lace-covered
plate, some of the most delicious
chicken sandwiches that it has ever been my fortune to
taste.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mr. Hemster, when the steward
had disappeared, “you’re on your uppers, I take
it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I understand.”</p>

<p>“Why, you’re down at bed-rock. Haven’t you been
in America? Don’t you know the language?”</p>

<p>“‘Yes’ is the answer to all your questions.”</p>

<p>“What’s the reason? Drink? Gambling?”</p>

<p>Lord, how good that champagne tasted! I laughed
from the pure, dry exhilaration of it.</p>

<p>“I wish I could say it was drink that brought me
to this pass,” I answered; “for this champagne shows
it would be a tempting road to ruin. I am not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
gambler, either. How I came to this pass would not
interest you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I take it that’s just an Englishman’s way of
saying it’s none of my business; but such is not the
fact. You want a job, and you have come to me for
it. Very well; I must know something about you.
Whether I can give you a job or not will depend.
You have said you could captain the ship or run
her engines. What makes you so confident of your
skill?”</p>

<p>“The fact is I possessed a yacht of my own not so
very long ago, and I captained her and I ran her engines
on different occasions.”</p>

<p>“That might be a recommendation, or it might not.
If, as captain, you wrecked your vessel, or if, as engineer,
you blew her up, these actions would hardly be
a certificate of competency.”</p>

<p>“I did neither. I sold the yacht in New York for
what it would bring.”</p>

<p>“How much money did you have when you bought
your yacht?”</p>

<p>“I had what you would call half a million.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say what I would call half a million?
What would you call it?”</p>

<p>“I should call it a hundred thousand.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see. You’re talking of pounds, and I’m
talking of dollars. You’re an Englishman, I suspect.
Are you an educated man?”</p>

<p>“Moderately so. Eton and Oxford,” said I, the
champagne beginning to have its usual effect on a
hungry man. However, the announcement of Eton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
and Oxford had no effect upon Mr. Hemster, so it did
not matter.</p>

<p>“Come, young fellow,” he said, with some impatience,
“tell me all about yourself, and don’t have
to be drawn out like a witness on the stand.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said I, “here is my story. After I left
Oxford I had some little influence, as you might
call it.”</p>

<p>“No, a ‘pull,’ I would call it. All right, where did
it land you?”</p>

<p>“It landed me as secretary to a Minister of the
Crown.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean a preacher?”</p>

<p>“No, I mean the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
he put me into the diplomatic service when he found
the Government was going to be defeated. I was secretary
of legation at Pekin and also here in Japan.”</p>

<p>I filled myself another glass of champagne, and,
holding it up to see the sparkles, continued jauntily:</p>

<p>“If I may go so far as to boast, I may say I was entrusted
with several delicate missions, and I carried
them through with reasonable success. I can both
read and write the Japanese language, and I know a
smattering of Chinese and a few dialects of the East,
which have stood me in good stead more than once.
To tell the truth, I was in a fair way for promotion and
honor when unfortunately a relative died and left me
the hundred thousand pounds that I spoke of.”</p>

<p>“Why unfortunately? If you had had any brains
you could have made that into millions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose I could. I thought I was going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
do it. I bought myself a yacht at Southampton and
sailed for New York. To make a long story short, it
was a gold mine and a matter of ten weeks which were
taken up with shooting and fishing in Canada. Then
I had the gold mine and the experience, while the
other fellow had the cash. He was good enough to
pay me a trifle for my steam yacht, which, as the
advertisements say, was ‘of no further use to the
owner.’”</p>

<p>As I sipped my champagne, the incidents I was relating
seemed to recede farther and farther back and
become of little consequence. In fact I felt like laughing
over them, and although in sober moments I should
have called the action of the man who got my money a
swindle, under the influence of dry ’78 his scheme became
merely a very clever exercise of wit. Mr. Hemster
was looking steadily at me, and for once his cigar
was almost motionless.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he murmured, more to himself than
to me, “I have always said the geographical position
of New York gives it a tremendous advantage over
Chicago. They never let the fools come West. They
have always the first whack at the moneyed Englishman,
and will have until we get a ship canal that will
let the liners through to Chicago direct. Fleeced in ten
weeks! Well, well! Go on, my son. What did you
do after you’d sold your yacht?”</p>

<p>“I took what money I had and made for the West.”</p>

<p>“Came to Chicago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Just our luck. After you had been well buncoed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
you came to Chicago. I swear I’m tempted to settle
in New York when I get back.”</p>

<p>“By the West I do not mean Chicago, Mr. Hemster.
I went right through to San Francisco and took a
steamer for Japan. I thought my knowledge of the
East and of the languages might be of advantage. I
was ashamed to return to England when I found I
could make no headway here. I tried to bring influence
to bear to get reinstated in the diplomatic service,
but my brand of statesman was out of office and nothing
could be done. I lived too expensively here at
first, hoping to make an impression and gain a foothold
that was worth having, and when I began to economize
it was too late. I took to living in the native quarter,
and descended from trying to get a clerkship into the
position of a man who is willing to take anything.
From my veranda on the hill up yonder I saw this boat
come in, like a white-winged sea-gull, and so I came
down, got into a sampan, and here I am, enjoying the
best meal I’ve had for a long time. ‘Here endeth the
first lesson,’” I concluded irreverently, pouring out
another glass of champagne.</p>

<p>Mr. Hemster did not reply for some moments. He
was evidently ruminating, and the end of his cigar went
round and round quicker and quicker.</p>

<p>“What might your name be?” he said at last.</p>

<p>“Rupert Tremorne.”</p>

<p>“Got a handle to it?”</p>

<p>“A title? Oh, no! Plain Mr. Tremorne.”</p>

<p>“I should say, off-hand, that a title runs in your
family somewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>“Well; I admit that Lord Tremorne is my cousin,
and we have a few others scattered about. However,
there’s little danger of it ever falling upon me. To
tell the truth, the family for the last few years has no
idea where I am, and now that I have lost my money I
don’t suppose they care very much. At least I have
seen no advertisements in the papers, asking for a man
of my description.”</p>

<p>“If you were secretary to the Minister of whatever
you call it, I don’t know but what you’d do for me. I
am short of a private secretary just at the present moment,
and I think you’d do.”</p>

<p>Whether it was the champagne, or the sandwiches,
or the prospect of getting something to do, and consequently
being able to pay my way, or all three combined,
I felt like throwing my hat into the air and uttering
a war-whoop; but something of native stolidity
counterbalanced the effect of the stimulant, and I was
astonished to hear myself reply very quietly:</p>

<p>“It would be folly for a man who had just applied
for the position of stoker to pretend he is not elated at
being offered a secretaryship. It is needless to say,
Mr. Hemster, that I accept with alacrity and gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s settled,” said the millionaire curtly.
“As to the matter of salary, I think you would be wise
to leave that to me. I have paid out a good deal of
money recently and got mighty little for it. If you can
turn the tide so that there is value received, you will
find me liberal in the matter of wages.”</p>

<p>“I am quite content to leave it so,” I rejoined, “but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
I think I ought in honesty to tell you, if you are expecting
a shrewd business man as your secretary who
will turn the tide of fortune in any way, you are likely
to be disappointed in me. I am afraid I am a very poor
business man.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that already,” replied Hemster. “I
can supply all the business qualifications that are needed
in this new combination. What I want of you is something
entirely different. You said you could speak
more languages than your own?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am very familiar with French and German,
and have also a smattering of Spanish and Italian. I
can read and write Japanese, speaking that language
and Chinese with reasonable fluency, and can even
jabber a little in Corean.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re my man,” said my host firmly. “I
suppose now you would not object to a little something
on account?”</p>

<p>“I should be very much obliged indeed if you have
confidence enough in me to make an advance. There
are some things I should like to buy before I come
aboard, and, not to put too fine a point to it, there are
some debts I should like to settle.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” commented Hemster shortly,
thrusting his hand deep in his trousers pocket, and
bringing out a handful of money which he threw on
the wicker table. “There ought to be something like
two hundred dollars there. Just count it and see, and
write me a receipt for it.”</p>

<p>I counted it, and, as I did so, thought he watched me
rather keenly out of the corner of his eye. There was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
more than two hundred dollars in the heap, and I told
him the amount. The Japanese brought up a sheet
of paper headed with a gorgeous gilt and scarlet monogram
and a picture of the yacht, and I wrote and
signed the receipt.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about the stores in town?”
he asked, nodding his head toward Nagasaki.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“They tell me Nagasaki is a great place for buying
crockery. I wish you would order sent to the yacht
three complete dinner sets, three tea sets, and three
luncheon sets. There is always a good deal of breakage
on a sea-going yacht.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” I replied. “Is there any particular pattern
you wish, or any limit to the price?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t need expensive sets; anything will
do. I’m not particular; in fact, I don’t care even to
see them; I leave that entirely to you, but tell the man
to pack them securely, each in a separate box. He is
to bring them aboard at half-past five this afternoon
precisely, and ask for me. Now, when can you join
us?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning, if that will be soon enough.”</p>

<p>“Very well; to-morrow morning at ten.”</p>

<p>I saw that he wished the interview terminated, as,
for the last few minutes, he had exhibited signs of uneasiness.
I therefore rose and said,&mdash;rather stammeringly,
I am afraid:</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemster, I don’t know how to thank you for
your kindness <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right; that’s all right,” he replied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
hastily, waving his hand; but before anything further
could be spoken there came up on deck the most beautiful
and stately creature I had ever beheld, superbly
attired. She cast not even a glance at me, but hurried
toward Mr. Hemster, crying impetuously:</p>

<p>“Oh, Poppa! I want to go into the town and shop!”</p>

<p>“Quite right, my dear,” said the old man; “I wonder
you’ve been so long about it. We’ve been in harbor
two or three hours. This is Mr. Rupert Tremorne,
my new private secretary. Mr. Tremorne, my
daughter.”</p>

<p>I made my bow, but it seemed to pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>“How do you do,” said the girl hastily; then, to her
father, “Poppa, I want some money!”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly, certainly,” repeated the old
gentleman, plunging his hand into his other pocket and
pulling out another handful of the “necessary.” As I
learned afterward, each of his pockets seemed to be a
sort of safe depository, which would turn forth any
amount of capital when searched. He handed the accumulation
to her, and she stuffed it hastily into a
small satchel that hung at her side.</p>

<p>“You are going to take Miss Stretton with you?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, of course.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Tremorne is cousin to Lord Tremorne, of England,”
said the old gentleman very slowly and solemnly.</p>

<p>I had been standing there rather stupidly, instead
of taking my departure, as I should have done, for I
may as well confess that I was astounded at the sumptuous
beauty of the girl before me, who had hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
cast not even a look in my direction. Now she raised
her lovely, indescribable eyes to mine, and I felt a thrill
extend to my finger-tips. Many handsome women
have I seen in my day, but none to compare with this
superb daughter of the West.</p>

<p>“Really!” she exclaimed with a most charming intonation
of surprise. Then she extended a white and
slim hand to me, and continued, “I am very glad to
meet you, Mr. Tremorne. Do you live in Nagasaki?”</p>

<p>“I have done so for the past year.”</p>

<p>“Then you know the town well?”</p>

<p>“I know it very well indeed.”</p>

<p>At this juncture another young woman came on
deck, and Miss Hemster turned quickly toward her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hilda!” she cried, “I shall not need you to-day.
Thanks ever so much.”</p>

<p>“Not need her?” exclaimed her father. “Why,
you can’t go into Nagasaki alone, my dear.”</p>

<p>“I have no intention of doing so,” she replied amiably,
“if Mr. Tremorne will be good enough to escort
me.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted,” I gasped, expecting an expostulation
from her father; but the old gentleman
merely said:</p>

<p>“All right, my dear; just as you please.”</p>

<p>“Rupert, my boy!” I said to my amazed self;

</div>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">A stairway</span> was slung on the other side of the
yacht from that on which I had ascended,
and at its foot lay a large and comfortable
boat belonging to the yacht, manned by four stout seamen.
Down this stairway and into the boat I escorted
Miss Hemster. She seated herself in the stern and
took the tiller-ropes in her hands, now daintily gloved.
I sat down opposite to her and was about to give a
command to the men to give way when she forestalled
me, and the oars struck the water simultaneously. As
soon as we had rounded the bow of the yacht there
was a sudden outcry from a half-naked Japanese boy
who was sculling about in a sampan.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?” asked Miss Hemster
with a little laugh. “Does he think we’re going
to desert this boat and take that floating coffin of his?”</p>

<p>“I think it is my own man,” I said; “and he fears
that his fare is leaving him without settling up. Have
I your permission to stop these men till he comes alongside?
He has been waiting patiently for me while I
talked with Mr. Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” said the girl, and in obedience to
her order the crew held water, and as the boy came
alongside I handed him more than double what I owed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
him, and he nearly upset his craft by bowing in amazed
acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“You’re an Englishman, I suppose,” said Miss
Hemster.</p>

<p>“In a sort of way I am, but really a citizen of the
world. For many years past I have been less in England
than in other countries.”</p>

<p>“For many years? Why, you talk as if you were an
old man, and you don’t look a day more than thirty.”</p>

<p>“My looks do not libel me, Miss Hemster,” I replied
with a laugh, “for I am not yet thirty.”</p>

<p>“I am twenty-one,” she said carelessly, “but every
one says I don’t look more than seventeen.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were younger than seventeen,” said
I, “when I first saw you a moment ago.”</p>

<p>“Did you really? I think it is very flattering of you
to say so, and I hope you mean it.”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed, Miss Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I look younger than Hilda?” she
asked archly, “most people do.”</p>

<p>“Hilda!” said I. “What Hilda?”</p>

<p>“Why, Hilda Stretton, my companion.”</p>

<p>“I have never seen her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you did; she was standing at the companion-way
and was coming with me when I preferred
to come with you.”</p>

<p>“I did not see her,” I said, shaking my head; “I
saw no one but you.”</p>

<p>The young lady laughed merrily,&mdash;a melodious ripple
of sound. I have heard women’s laughter compared
to the tinkle of silver bells, but to that musical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
tintinnabulation was now added something so deliciously
human and girlish that the whole effect was
nothing short of enchanting. Conversation now ceased,
for we were drawing close to the shore. I directed the
crew where to land, and the young lady sprang up the
steps without assistance from me,&mdash;before, indeed, I
could proffer any. I was about to follow when one
of the sailors touched me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“The old man,” he said in a husky whisper, nodding
his head toward the yacht, “told me to tell you
that when you buy that crockery you’re not to let Miss
Hemster know anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming?” cried Miss Hemster to me
from the top of the wharf.</p>

<p>I ascended the steps with celerity and begged her
pardon for my delay.</p>

<p>“I am not sprightly seventeen, you see,” I said.</p>

<p>She laughed, and I put her in a ’rickshaw drawn by
a stalwart Japanese, got into one myself, and we set
off for the main shopping street. I was rather at a
loss to know exactly what the sailor’s message meant,
but I took it to be that for some reason Mr. Hemster
did not wish his daughter to learn that he was indulging
so freely in dinner sets. As it was already three
o’clock in the afternoon, I realized that there would be
some difficulty in getting the goods aboard by five
o’clock, unless the young lady dismissed me when we
arrived at the shops. This, however, did not appear
to be her intention in the least; when our human steeds
stopped, she gave me her hand lightly as she
descended, and then said, with her captivating smile:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>“I want you to take me at once to a china shop.”</p>

<p>“To a what?” I cried.</p>

<p>“To a shop where they sell dishes,&mdash;dinner sets and
that sort of thing. You know what I mean,&mdash;a crockery
store.”</p>

<p>I did, but I was so astonished by the request coming
right on the heels of the message from her father, and
taken in conjunction with his previous order, that I
am afraid I stood looking very much like a fool,
whereupon she laughed heartily, and I joined her. I
saw she was quite a merry young lady, with a keen
sense of the humour of things.</p>

<p>“Haven’t they any crockery stores in this town?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, there are plenty of them,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Why, you look as if you had never heard of such a
thing before. Take me, then, to whichever is the best.
I want to buy a dinner set and a tea set the very first
thing.”</p>

<p>I bowed, and, somewhat to my embarrassment, she
took my arm, tripping along by my side as if she were
a little girl of ten, overjoyed at her outing, to which
feeling she gave immediate expression.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this jolly?” she cried.</p>

<p>“It is the most undeniably jolly shopping excursion
I ever engaged in,” said I, fervently and truthfully.</p>

<p>“You see,” she went on, “the delight of this sort of
thing is that we are in an utterly foreign country and
can do just as we please. That is why I did not wish
Hilda to come with us. She is rather prim and has
notions of propriety which are all right at home, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
what is the use of coming to foreign countries if you
cannot enjoy them as you wish to?”</p>

<p>“I think that is a very sensible idea,” said I.</p>

<p>“Why, it seems as if you and I were members of a
travelling theatrical company, and were taking part in
‘The Mikado,’ doesn’t it? What funny little people
they are all around us! Nagasaki doesn’t seem real.
It looks as if it were set on a stage,&mdash;don’t you think
so?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, I am rather accustomed to it.
I have lived here for more than a year, as I told
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you said. I have not got used to it yet.
Have you ever seen ‘The Mikado?’”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the Emperor or the play?”</p>

<p>“At the moment I was thinking of the play.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have seen it, and the real Mikado, too, and
spoken with him.”</p>

<p>“Have you, indeed? How lucky you are!”</p>

<p>“You speak truly, Miss Hemster, and I never knew
how lucky I was until to-day.”</p>

<p>She bent her head and laughed quietly to herself. I
thought we were more like a couple of school children
than members of a theatrical troupe, but as I never was
an actor I cannot say how the latter behave when they
are on the streets of a strange town.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have met your kind of man before, Mr. Tremorne.
You don’t mind what you say when you are
talking to a lady as long as it is something flattering.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, Miss Hemster, that quite the contrary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
is the case. I never flatter; and if I have been
using a congratulatory tone it has been directed entirely
to myself and to my own good fortune.”</p>

<p>“There you go again. How did you come to meet
the Mikado?”</p>

<p>“I used to be in the diplomatic service in Japan, and
my duties on several occasions brought me the honor
of an audience with His Majesty.”</p>

<p>“How charmingly you say that, and I can see that
you believe it from your heart; and although we are
democratic, I believe it, too. I always love diplomatic
society, and enjoyed a good deal of it in Washington,
and my imagination always pictured behind them the
majesty of royalty, so I have come abroad to see the
real thing. I was presented at Court in London, Mr.
Tremorne. Now, please don’t say that you congratulate
the Court!”</p>

<p>“There is no need of my saying it, as it has already
been said; or perhaps I should say ‘it goes without
saying.’”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, Mr. Tremorne; I think
you are the most polite man I ever met. I want you
to do me a very great favor and introduce me to the
higher grades of diplomatic society in Nagasaki during
our stay here.”</p>

<p>“I regret, Miss Hemster, that that is impossible,
because I have been out of the service for some years
now. Besides, the society here is consular rather than
diplomatic. The Legation is at the capital, you know.
Nagasaki is merely a commercial city.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it? I thought perhaps you had been seeing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
my father to-day because of some consular business,
or that sort of thing, pertaining to the yacht.”</p>

<p>As the girl said this I realized, with a suddenness
that was disconcerting, the fact that I was practically
acting under false pretences. I was her father’s
humble employee, and she did not know it. I remembered
with a pang when her father first mentioned my
name she paid not the slightest attention to it; but
when he said I was the cousin of Lord Tremorne the
young lady had favored me with a glance I was not
soon to forget. Therefore, seeing that Mr. Hemster
had neglected to make my position clear, it now became
my duty to give some necessary explanation, so
that his daughter might not continue an acquaintance
that was rapidly growing almost intimate under her
misapprehension as to who I was. I saw with a pang
that a humiliation was in store for me such as always
lies in wait for a man who momentarily steps out of his
place and receives consideration which is not his social
due.</p>

<p>I had once before suffered the experience which was
now ahead of me, and it was an episode I did not care
to repeat, although I failed to see how it could be honestly
avoided. On my return to Japan I sought out the
man in the diplomatic service who had been my greatest
friend and for whom I had in former days accomplished
some slight services, because my status in the
ranks was superior to his own. Now that there was an
opportunity for a return of these services, I called
upon him, and was received with a cordiality that went
to my discouraged heart; but the moment he learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
I was in need, and that I could not regain the place I
had formerly held, he congealed in the most tactful
manner possible. It was an interesting study in human
deportment. His manner and words were simply unimpeachable,
but there gathered around him a mantle
of impenetrable frigidity the collection of which was a
triumph in tactful intercourse. As he grew colder and
colder, I grew hotter and hotter. I managed to withdraw
without showing, I hope, the deep humiliation I
felt. Since that time I had never sought a former acquaintance,
or indeed any countryman of my own, preferring
to be indebted to my old friend Yansan on the
terrace above or the sampan-boy on the waters below.
The man I speak of has risen high and is rising higher
in my old profession, and every now and then his last
words ring in my ears and warm them,&mdash;words of
counterfeit cordiality as he realized they were the last
that he should probably ever speak to me:</p>

<p>“Well, my dear fellow, I’m ever so glad you called.
If I can do anything for you, you must be sure and
let me know.”</p>

<p>As I had already let him know, my reply that I
should certainly do so must have sounded as hollow as
his own smooth phrase.</p>

<p>Unpleasant as that episode was, the situation was
now ten times worse, as it involved a woman,&mdash;and a
lovely woman at that,&mdash;who had treated me with a
kindness she would feel misplaced when she understood
the truth. However, there was no help for it,
so, clearing my throat, I began:</p>

<p>“Miss Hemster, when I took the liberty of calling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
on your father this morning, I was a man penniless
and out of work. I went to the yacht in the hope that
I might find something to do. I was fortunate enough
to be offered the position of private secretary to Mr.
Hemster, which position I have accepted.”</p>

<p>The young lady, as I expected, instantly withdrew
her hand from my arm, and stood there facing me, I
also coming to a halt; and thus we confronted each
other in the crowded street of Nagasaki. Undeniable
amazement overspread her beautiful countenance.</p>

<p>“Why!” she gasped, “you are, then, Poppa’s hired
man?”</p>

<p>I winced a trifle, but bowed low to her.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I replied, “you have stated the fact with
great truth and terseness.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” she said, “that you are to
be with us after this on the yacht?”</p>

<p>“I suspect such to be your father’s intention.”
Then, to my amazement, she impulsively thrust forth
both her hands and clasped mine.</p>

<p>“Why, how perfectly lovely!” she exclaimed. “I
haven’t had a white man to talk with except Poppa for
ages and ages. But you must remember that everything
I want you to do, you are to do. You are to be
<em>my</em> hired man; Poppa won’t mind.”</p>

<p>“You will find me a most devoted retainer, Miss
Hemster.”</p>

<p>“I do love that word ‘retainer,’” she cried enthusiastically.
“It is like the magic talisman of the
‘Arabian Nights,’ and conjures up at once visions of
a historic tower, mullioned windows, and all that sort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of thing. When you were made a bankrupt, Mr. Tremorne,
was there one faithful old retainer who refused
to desert you as the others had done?”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear young lady, you are thinking of the
romantic drama now, as you were alluding to comic
opera a little while ago. I believe, in the romantic
drama, the retainer, like the man with the mortgage,
never lets go. I am thankful to say I had no such person
in my employ. He would have been an awful
nuisance. It was hard enough to provide for myself,
not to mention a retainer. But here we are at the
crockery shop.”</p>

<p>I escorted her in, and she was soon deeply absorbed
in the mysteries of this pattern or that of the various
wares exposed to her choice. Meanwhile I took the
opportunity to give the proprietor instructions in his
own language to send to the yacht before five o’clock
what Mr. Hemster had ordered, and I warned the man
he was not to mix up the order I had just given him
with that of the young lady. The Japanese are very
quick at comprehension, and when Miss Hemster and
I left the place I had no fear of any complication arising
through my instructions.</p>

<p>We wandered from shop to shop, the girl enthusiastic
over Nagasaki, much to my wonder, for there are
other places in Japan more attractive than this commercial
town; but the glamor of the East cast its spell
over the young woman, and, although I was rather
tired of the Orient, I must admit that the infection of
her high spirits extended to my own feelings. A week
ago it would have appeared impossible that I should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
be enjoying myself so thoroughly as I was now doing.
It seemed as if years had rolled from my shoulders, and
I was a boy once more, living in a world where conventionality
was unknown.</p>

<p>The girl herself was in a whirlwind of glee, and it
was not often that the shopkeepers of Nagasaki met so
easy a victim. She seemed absolutely reckless in the
use of money, paying whatever was asked for anything
that took her fancy. In a very short time all her ready
cash was gone, but that made not the slightest difference.
She ordered here and there with the extravagance
of a queen, on what she called the “C.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;D.”
plan, which I afterward learned was an American
phrase meaning, “Collect on delivery.” Her peregrinations
would have tired out half-a-dozen men, but she
showed no signs of fatigue. I felt a hesitation about
inviting her to partake of refreshment, but I need not
have been so backward.</p>

<p>“Talking of comic operas,” she exclaimed as we
came out of the last place, “Aren’t there any tea-houses
here, such as we see on the stage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, plenty of them,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Well,” she exclaimed with a ripple of laughter,
“take me to the wickedest of them. What is the use
of going around the world in a big yacht if you don’t
see life?”</p>

<p>I wondered what her father would say if he knew,
but I acted the faithful retainer to the last, and did as
I was bid. She expressed the utmost delight in everything
she saw, and it was well after six o’clock when
we descended from our ’rickshaw at the landing. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
boat was awaiting us, and in a short time we were
alongside the yacht once more. It had been a wild,
tempestuous outing, and I somewhat feared the stern
disapproval of an angry parent. He was leaning over
the rail revolving an unlit cigar.</p>

<p>“Oh, Poppa!” she cried up at him with enthusiasm,
“I have had a perfectly splendid time. Mr. Tremorne
knows Nagasaki like a book. He has taken me everywhere,”
she cried, with unnecessary emphasis on the
last word.</p>

<p>The millionaire was entirely unperturbed.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said. “I hope you haven’t
tired yourself out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I should be delighted to do it all over
again! Has anybody sent anything aboard for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the old man, “there’s been a procession
of people here since you left. Dinner’s ready, Mr.
Tremorne. You’ll come aboard, of course, and take
pot-luck with us?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mr. Hemster,” I said; “I must
get a sampan and make my way into town again.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say; but you don’t need a sampan,
these men will row you back again. See you to-morrow
at ten, then.”</p>

<p>Miss Hemster, now on deck, leaned over the rail
and daintily blew me a kiss from the tips of her slender
fingers.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much, retainer,” she cried, as I lifted
my hat in token of farewell.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I was</span> speedily rowed ashore in a state of great
exaltation. The sudden change in my expectations
was bewilderingly Eastern in its completeness.
The astonishingly intimate companionship of
this buoyant, effervescent girl had affected me as did
the bottle of champagne earlier in the day. I was well
aware that many of my former acquaintances would
have raised their hands in horror at the thought of a
girl wandering about an Eastern city with me, entirely
unchaperoned; but I had been so long down on my
luck, and the experiences I had encountered with so-called
fashionable friends had been so bitter, that the
little finicky rules of society seemed of small account
when compared with the realities of life. The girl was
perfectly untrained and impulsive, but that she was a
true-hearted woman I had not the slightest doubt.
Was I in love with her? I asked myself, and at that
moment my brain was in too great a whirl to be able
to answer the question satisfactorily to myself. My
short ten weeks in America had given me no such acquaintance
as this, although the two months and a half
had cost me fifty thousand dollars a week, certainly
the most expensive living that any man is likely to encounter.
I had met a few American women, but they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
all seemed as cold and indifferent as our own, while
here was a veritable child of nature, as untrammelled
by the little rules of society as could well be imagined.
After all, were these rules so important as I had hitherto
supposed them to be? Certainly not, I replied to
myself, as I stepped ashore.</p>

<p>I climbed the steep hill to my former residence with
my head in the air in every sense of the word. Many
a weary journey I had taken up that forlorn path, and
it had often been the up-hill road of discouragement;
but to-night Japan was indeed the land of enchantment
which so many romantic writers have depicted it. I
thought of the girl and thought of her father, wondering
what my new duties were to be. If to-day were a
sample of them then truly was Paradise regained, as
the poet has it. I had told Mr. Hemster that I needed
time to purchase necessary things for the voyage, but
this would take me to very few shops. I had in store
in Nagasaki a large trunk filled with various suits of
clothing, a trunk of that comprehensive kind which
one buys in America. This was really in pawn. I had
delivered it to a shopkeeper who had given me a line of
credit now long since ended, but I knew I should find
my goods and chattels safe when I came with the
money, as indeed proved to be the case.</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to meet Yansan once more,
bowing as lowly as if I were in truth a millionaire. I
had often wondered what would happen if I had been
compelled to tell the grimacing old fellow I had no
money to pay him. Would his excessive politeness
have stood the strain? Perhaps so, but luckily his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
good nature was not to be put to the test. I could
scarcely refrain from grasping his two hands, as Miss
Hemster had grasped mine, and dancing with him
around the bare habitation which he owned and which
had so long been my shelter. However, I said calmly
to him:</p>

<p>“Yansan, my ship has come in, as I told you this
morning; and now, if you will bring me that bill, errors
and all, I will pay you three times its amount.”</p>

<p>Speechless, the old man dropped on his knees and
beat his forehead against the floor.</p>

<p>“Excellency has always been too good to me!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>I tried to induce good old Yansan to share supper
with me; but he was too much impressed with my
greatness and could do nothing but bow and bow and
serve me.</p>

<p>After the repast I went down into the town again,
redeemed my trunk and its contents, bought what I
needed, and ordered everything forwarded to the yacht
before seven o’clock next morning. Then I went to a
tea-house, and drank tea, and thought over the wonderful
events of the day, after which I climbed the hill
again for a night’s rest.</p>

<p>I was very sorry to bid farewell to old Yansan next
morning, and I believe he was very sorry to part with
his lodger. Once more at the waterside I hailed my
sampan-boy, who was now all eagerness to serve me,
and he took me out to the yacht, which was evidently
ready for an early departure. Her whole crew was
now aboard, and most of them had had a day’s leave in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Nagasaki yesterday. The captain was pacing up and
down the bridge, and smoke was lazily trailing from
the funnel.</p>

<p>Arrived on deck I found Mr. Hemster in his former
position in the cane chair, with his back still toward
Nagasaki, which town I believe he never glanced at
all the time his yacht was in harbor. I learned afterward
that he thought it compared very unfavorably
with Chicago. His unlighted cigar was describing circles
in the air, and all in all I might have imagined he
had not changed from the position I left him in the
day before if I had not seen him leaning over the rail
when I escorted his daughter back to the yacht. He
gave me no further greeting than a nod, which did not
err on the side of effusiveness.</p>

<p>I inquired of the Japanese boy, who stood ready to
receive me with all the courtesy of his race, whether my
luggage had come aboard, and he informed me that it
had. I approached Mr. Hemster, bidding him good-morning,
but he gave a side nod of his head toward the
Japanese boy and said, “He’ll show you to your
cabin,” so I followed the youth down the companion-way
to my quarters. The yacht, as I have said, was
very big. The main saloon extended from side to side,
and was nearly as large as the dining-room of an ocean
liner. Two servants with caps and aprons, exactly like
English housemaids, were dusting and putting things
to rights as I passed through.</p>

<p>My cabin proved ample in size, and was even more
comfortably equipped than I expected to find it. My
luggage was there, and I took the opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
changing my present costume for one of more nautical
cut, and, placing a yachting-cap on my head, I went on
deck again. I had expected, from all the preparedness
I had seen, to hear the anchor-chain rattle up before I
was equipped, and feared for the moment that I had
delayed the sailing of the yacht; but on looking at my
watch as I went on deck I found it was not yet ten
o’clock, so I was in ample time, as had been arranged.</p>

<p>I had seen nothing of Miss Hemster, and began to
suspect that she had gone ashore and that the yacht
was awaiting her return; but a glance showed me that
all the yacht’s boats were in place, so if the young
woman had indulged in a supplementary shopping-tour
it must have been in a sampan, which was unlikely.</p>

<p>The old gentleman, as I approached him, eyed my
yachting toggery with what seemed to me critical disapproval.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “you’re all fitted out for a cruise,
aren’t you? Have a cigar,”&mdash;and he offered me his
case.</p>

<p>I took the weed and replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, and you seem ready to begin a cruise. May
I ask where you are going?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly,” he replied carelessly. “I
haven’t quite made up my mind yet. I thought perhaps
you might be able to decide the matter.”</p>

<p>“To decide!” I answered in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, sitting up suddenly and throwing
the cigar overboard. “What nonsense were you talking
to my daughter yesterday?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>I was so taken aback at this unexpected and gruff
inquiry that I fear I stood there looking rather idiotic,
which was evidently the old man’s own impression of
me, for he scowled in a manner that was extremely disconcerting.
I had no wish to adopt the Adam-like expedient
of blaming the woman; but, after all, he had
been there when I went off alone with her, and it was
really not my fault that I was the girl’s sole companion
in Nagasaki. All my own early training and later
social prejudices led me to sympathize with Mr. Hemster’s
evident ill-humour regarding our shore excursion,
but nevertheless it struck me as a trifle belated.
He should have objected when the proposal was made.</p>

<p>“Really, sir,” I stammered at last, “I’m afraid I
must say I don’t exactly know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“I think I spoke plainly enough,” he answered. “I
want you to be careful what you say, and if you come
with me to my office, where we shall not be interrupted,
I’ll give you a straight talking to, so that we may
avoid trouble in the future.”</p>

<p>I was speechless with amazement, and also somewhat
indignant. If he took this tone with me, my
place was evidently going to be one of some difficulty.
However, needs must when the devil drives, even if he
comes from Chicago; and although his words were bitter
to endure, I was in a manner helpless and forced to
remember my subordinate position, which, in truth, I
had perhaps forgotten during my shopping experiences
with his impulsive daughter. Yet I had myself made
her aware of my situation, and if our conversation at
times had been a trifle free and easy I think the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
fault&mdash;&mdash;but there&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;&mdash;I’m at the
Adam business again. The woman tempted me, and I
did talk. I felt humiliated that even to myself I placed
any blame upon her.</p>

<p>Mr. Hemster rose, nipped off the point of another
cigar, and strode along the deck to the companion-way,
I following him like a confessed culprit. He led me to
what he called his office, a room not very much larger
than my own, but without the bunk that took up part
of the space in my cabin; in fact a door led out of it
which, I afterward learned, communicated with his
bedroom. The office was fitted up with an American
roll-top desk fastened to the floor, a copying-press, a
typewriter, filing-cases from floor to ceiling, and other
paraphernalia of a completely equipped business establishment.
There was a swivelled armchair before the
desk, into which Mr. Hemster dropped and leaned
back, the springs creaking as he did so. There was but
one other chair in the room, and he motioned me into
it.</p>

<p>“See here!” he began abruptly. “Did you tell my
daughter yesterday that you were a friend of the Mikado’s?”</p>

<p>“God bless me, no!” I was surprised into replying.
“I said nothing of the sort.”</p>

<p>“Well, you left her under that impression.”</p>

<p>“I cannot see, Mr. Hemster, how such can be the
case. I told Miss Hemster that I had met the Mikado
on several occasions, but I explained to her that these
occasions were entirely official, and each time I merely
accompanied a superior officer in the diplomatic service.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Although I have spoken with His Majesty, it was
merely because questions were addressed to me, and
because I was the only person present sufficiently conversant
with the Japanese language to make him a
reply in his own tongue.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see,” mused the old gentleman; “but Gertie
somehow got it into her head that you could introduce
us personally to the Mikado. I told her it was
not likely that a fellow I had picked up strapped from
the streets of Nagasaki, as one might say, would be
able to give us an introduction that would amount to
anything.”</p>

<p>I felt myself getting red behind the ears as Mr.
Hemster put my situation with, what seemed to me,
such unnecessary brutality. Yet, after all, what he had
said was the exact truth, and I had no right to complain
of it, for if there was money in my pocket at that
moment it was because he had placed it there; and then
I saw intuitively that he meant no offence, but was
merely repeating what he had said to his daughter,
placing the case in a way that would be convincing to
a man, whatever effect it might have on a woman’s
mind.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” I said, “that I must have expressed
myself clumsily to Miss Hemster. I think I told her,&mdash;but
I make the statement subject to correction,&mdash;that I
had so long since severed my connection with diplomatic
service in Tokio that even the slight power I then
possessed no longer exists. If I still retained my former
position I should scarcely be more helpless than I
am now, so far as what you require is concerned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I told her,” growled the old
man. “I suppose you haven’t any suggestion to make
that would help me out at all?”</p>

<p>“The only suggestion I can make is this, and indeed
I think the way seems perfectly clear. You no doubt
know your own Ambassador,&mdash;perhaps have letters
of introduction to him,&mdash;and he may very easily arrange
for you to have an audience with His Majesty
the Mikado.”</p>

<p>“Oh! our Ambassador!” growled Mr. Hemster in
tones of great contempt; “he’s nothing but a one-horse
politician.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” said I, “his position is such that by
merely exercising the prerogatives of his office he
could get you what you wanted.”</p>

<p>“No, he can’t,” maintained the old gentleman
stoutly. “Still, I shouldn’t say anything against him;
he’s all right. He did his best for us, and if we could
have waited long enough at Yokohama perhaps he
might have fixed up an audience with the Mikado.
But I’d had enough of hanging on around there, and
so I sailed away. Now, my son, I said I was going to
give you a talking to, and I am. I’ll tell you just how
the land lies, so you can be of some help to me and not
a drawback. I want you to be careful of what you say
to Gertie about such people as the Mikado, because it
excites her and makes her think certain things are easy
when they’re not.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry if I have said anything that led to
a misapprehension. I certainly did not intend to.”</p>

<p>“No, no! I understand that. I am not blaming you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
a bit. I just want you to catch on to the situation,
that’s all. Gertie likes you first rate; she told me so,
and I’m ever so much obliged to you for the trouble
you took yesterday afternoon in entertaining her. She
told me everything you said and did, and it was all
right. Now Gertie has always been accustomed to
moving in the very highest society. She doesn’t care
for anything else, and she took to you from the very
first. I was glad of that, because I should have consulted
her before I hired you. Nevertheless, I knew the
moment you spoke that you were the man I wanted,
and so I took the risk. I never cared for high society
myself; my intercourse has been with business
men. I understand them, and I like them; but I don’t
cut any figure in high society, and I don’t care to,
either. Now, with Gertie it’s different. She’s been
educated at the finest schools, and I’ve taken her all
over Europe, where we stayed at the very best hotels
and met the very best people in both Europe and
America. Why, we’ve met more Sirs and Lords and
Barons and High Mightinesses than you can shake a
stick at. Gertie, she’s right at home among those kind
of people, and, if I do say it myself, she’s quite capable
of taking her place among the best of them, and she
knows it. There never was a time we came in to the
best table d’hôte in Europe that every eye wasn’t
turned toward her, and she’s been the life of the most
noted hotels that exist, no matter where they are, and
no matter what their price is.”</p>

<p>I ventured to remark that I could well believe this
to have been the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and you don’t need to take my word for it,”
continued the old man with quite perceptible pride;
“you may ask any one that was there. Whether it
was a British Lord, or a French Count, or a German
Baron, or an Italian Prince, it was just the same. I
admit that it seemed to me that some of those nobles
didn’t amount to much. But that’s neither here nor
there; as I told you before, I’m no judge. I suppose
they have their usefulness in creation, even though I’m
not able to see it. But the result of it all was that Gertie
got tired of them, and, as she is an ambitious girl
and a real lady, she determined to strike higher, and
so, when we bought this yacht and came abroad again,
she determined to go in for Kings, so I’ve been on a
King hunt ever since, and to tell the truth it has cost
me a lot of money and I don’t like it. Not that I mind
the money if it resulted in anything, but it hasn’t resulted
in anything; that is, it hasn’t amounted to
much. Gertie doesn’t care for the ordinary presentation
at Court, for nearly anybody can have that. What
she wants is to get a King or an Emperor right here on
board this yacht at lunch or tea, or whatever he wants,
and enjoy an intimate conversation with him, just like
she’s had with them no-account Princes. Then she
wants a column or two account of that written up for
the Paris edition of the “New York Herald,” and she
wants to have it cabled over to America. Now she’s
the only chick or child I’ve got. Her mother’s been
dead these fifteen years, and Gertie is all I have in the
world, so I’m willing to do anything she wants done,
no matter whether I like it or not. But I don’t want<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to engage in anything that doesn’t succeed. Success is
the one thing that amounts to anything. The man who
is a failure cuts no ice. And so it rather grinds me to
confess that I’ve been a failure in this King business.
Now I don’t know much about Kings, but it strikes
me they’re just like other things in this world. If you
want to get along with them, you must study them.
It’s like climbing a stair; if you want to get to the top
you must begin at the lowest step. If you try to take
one stride up to the top landing, why you’re apt to
come down on your head. I told Gertie it was no use
beginning with the German Emperor, for we’d have to
get accustomed to the low-down Kings and gradually
work up. She believes in aiming high. That’s all
right ordinarily, but it isn’t a practical proposition.
Still, I let her have her way and did the best I could,
but it was no use. I paid a German Baron a certain
sum for getting the Emperor on board my yacht, but
he didn’t deliver the goods. So I said to Gertie: ‘My
girl, we’d better go to India, or some place where
Kings are cheap, and practise on them first.’ She
hated to give in, but she’s a reasonable young woman
if you take her the right way. Well, the long and the
short of it was that we sent the yacht around to Marseilles,
and went down from Paris to meet her there,
and sailed to Egypt, and, just as I said, we had no difficulty
at all in raking in the Khedive. But that wasn’t
very satisfactory when all’s said and done. Gertie
claimed he wasn’t a real king, and I say he’s not a
real gentleman. We had a little unpleasantness there,
and he became altogether too friendly, so we sailed off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
down through the Canal a hunting Kings, till at last
we got here to Japan. Now we’re up against it once
more, and I suppose this here Mikado has hobnobbed
so much with real Emperors and that sort of thing that
he thinks himself a white man like the rest. So I says
to Gertie, ‘There’s a genuine Emperor in Corea, good
enough to begin on, and we’ll go there,’ and that’s
how we came round from Yokohama to Nagasaki, and
dropped in here to get a few things we might not be
able to obtain in Corea. The moment I saw you and
learned that you knew a good deal about the East, it
struck me that if I took you on as private secretary
you would be able to give me a few points, and perhaps
take charge of this business altogether. Do you
think you’d be able to do that?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said hesitatingly, “I’m not sure, but if
I can be of any use to you on such a quest it will be in
Corea. I’ve been there on two or three occasions, and
each time had an audience with the King.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call him the King? Isn’t he an Emperor?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve always called him the King, but I’ve
heard people term him the Emperor.”</p>

<p>“The American papers always call him an Emperor.
So you think you could manage it, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that there would be any difficulty
about the matter. Of course you are aware he is merely
a savage.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re all savages out here, aren’t they? I
don’t suppose he’s any worse or any better than the
Mikado.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, the Mikado belongs to one of the most ancient
civilizations in the world. I don’t think the two potentates
are at all on a par.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right. That just bears out what I
was saying, that it’s the correct thing to begin with the
lowest of them. You see I hate to admit I’m too old
to learn anything, and I think I can learn this King
business if I stick long enough at it. But I don’t believe
in a man trying to make a grand piano before
he knows how to handle a saw. So you see, Mr. Tremorne,
the position is just this. I want to sail for
Corea, and Gertie, she wants to go back to Yokohama
and tackle the Mikado again, thinking you can pull it
off this time.”</p>

<p>“I dislike very much to disagree with a lady,” I
said, “but I think your plan is the more feasible of the
two. I do not think it would be possible to get the Mikado
to come aboard this yacht, but it might be that the
King of Corea would accept your invitation.”</p>

<p>“What’s the name of the capital of that place?”
asked Mr. Hemster.</p>

<p>“It is spelled S-e-o-u-l, and is pronounced ‘Sool.’”</p>

<p>“How far is it from here?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly, but it must be something
like four hundred miles, perhaps a little more.”</p>

<p>“It is on the sea?”</p>

<p>“No. It lies some twenty-six miles inland by road,
and more than double that distance by the winding
river Han.”</p>

<p>“Can I steam up that river with this yacht to the
capital?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t think you could. You could go part
way, perhaps, but I imagine your better plan would be
to moor at the port of Chemulpo and go to Seoul by
road, although the road is none of the best.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a little naphtha launch on board. I suppose
the river is big enough for us to go up to the capital
in that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose you could do it in a small launch,
but the river is so crooked that I doubt if you would
gain much time, although you might gain in comfort.”</p>

<p>“Very well, we’ll make for that port, whatever you
call it,” said Hemster, rising. “Now, if you’ll just
take an armchair on deck, and smoke, I’ll give instructions
to the captain.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> had been a long time together in the little
office, longer even than this extended conversation
would lead a reader to imagine,
and as I went through the saloon I saw that they were
laying the table for lunch, a sight by no means ungrateful
to me, for I had risen early and enjoyed but a small
and frugal breakfast. I surmised from the preparations
going forward that I should in the near future
have something better than rice. When I reached the
deck I saw the captain smoking a pipe and still pacing
the bridge with his hands in his pockets. He was a
grizzled old sea-dog, who, I found later, had come from
the Cape Cod district, and was what he looked, a most
capable man. I went aft and sat down, not wishing to
go forward and became acquainted with the captain,
as I expected every moment that Mr. Hemster would
come up and give him his sailing-orders. But time
passed on and nothing happened, merely the same state
of tension that occurs when every one is ready to move
and no move is made. At last the gong sounded for
lunch. I saw the captain pause in his promenade,
knock the ashes out of his pipe into the palm of his
hand, and prepare to go down. So I rose and descended
the stairway, giving a nod of recognition to
the captain, who followed at my heels. The table was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
laid for five persons. Mr. Hemster occupied the position
at the head of it, and on his right sat his daughter,
her head bent down over the tablecloth. On the
opposite side, at Mr. Hemster’s left, sat the young lady
of whom I had had a glimpse the afternoon before.
The captain pushed past me with a gruff, “How de
do, all,” which was not responded to. He took the
place at the farther end of the table. If I have described
the situation on deck as a state of tension, much
more so was the atmosphere of the dining-saloon.
The silence was painful, and, not knowing what better
to do, I approached Miss Hemster and said pleasantly:</p>

<p>“Good-morning. I hope you are none the worse
for your shopping expedition of yesterday.”</p>

<p>The young woman did not look up or reply till her
father said in beseeching tones:</p>

<p>“Gertie, Mr. Tremorne is speaking to you.”</p>

<p>Then she glanced at me with eyes that seemed to
sparkle dangerously.</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do?” she said rapidly. “Your
place is over there by Miss Stretton.”</p>

<p>There was something so insulting in the tone and inflection
that it made the words, simple as they were,
seem like a slap in the face. Their purport seemed to
be to put me in my proper position in that society, to
warn me that, if I had been treated as a friend the day
before, conditions were now changed, and I was merely,
as she had previously remarked, her father’s hired
man. My situation was anything but an enviable one,
and as there was nothing to say I merely bowed low to
the girl, walked around behind the captain, and took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
my place beside Miss Stretton, as I had been commanded
to do. I confess I was deeply hurt by the
studied insolence of look and voice; but a moment
later I felt that I was probably making a mountain of
a molehill, for the good, bluff captain said, as if nothing
unusual had happened:</p>

<p>“That’s right, young man; I see you have been
correctly brought up. Always do what the women tell
you. Obey orders if you break owners. That’s what
we do in our country. In our country, sir, we allow
the women to rule, and their word is law, even though
the men vote.”</p>

<p>“Such is not the case in the East,” I could not help
replying.</p>

<p>“Why,” said the captain, “it’s the East I’m talking
about. All throughout the Eastern States, yes,
and the Western States, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” I replied, “I was referring
to the East of Asia. The women don’t rule in
these countries.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the staunch captain, “then that’s the
reason they amount to so little. I never knew an
Eastern country yet that was worth the powder to blow
it up.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” said I, “that your rule does not prove
universally good. It’s a woman who reigns in China,
and I shouldn’t hold that Empire up as an example
to others.”</p>

<p>The captain laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Young man, you’re contradicting yourself.
You’re excited, I guess. You said a minute ago that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
women didn’t rule in the East, and now you show
that the largest country in the East <em>is</em> ruled by a
woman. You can’t have it both ways, you know.”</p>

<p>I laughed somewhat dismally in sympathy with him,
and, lunch now being served, the good man devoted his
entire attention to eating. As no one else said a word
except the captain and myself, I made a feeble but
futile attempt to cause the conversation to become general.
I glanced at my fair neighbor to the right, who
had not looked up once since I entered. Miss Stretton
was not nearly so handsome a girl as Miss Hemster,
yet nevertheless in any ordinary company she would be
regarded as very good-looking. She had a sweet and
sympathetic face, and at the present moment it was
rosy red.</p>

<p>“Have you been in Nagasaki?” I asked, which was
a stupid question, for I knew she had not visited the
town the day before, and unless she had gone very
early there was no time for her to have been ashore
before I came aboard.</p>

<p>She answered “No” in such low tones that, fearing
I had not heard it, she cleared her throat, and said
“No” again. Then she raised her eyes for one brief
second, cast a sidelong glance at me, so appealing and
so vivid with intelligence, that I read it at once to
mean, “Oh, please do not talk to me.”</p>

<p>The meal was most excellent, yet I never remember
to have endured a half-hour so unpleasant. Across
the table from me, Miss Hemster had pushed away
plate after plate and had touched nothing. When I
spoke to her companion she began drumming nervously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
on the tablecloth with her fingers, as if she had great
difficulty in preventing herself giving expression to an
anger that was only too palpable. Her father went
on stolidly with his lunch, and made no effort to relieve
the rigor of the amazing situation. As soon as the
main dish had been served and disposed of, the captain
rose, and, nodding to the company, made for the companion-way.
Once there he turned on his heel and
said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemster, any orders?”</p>

<p>Before her father could reply, the young lady rose
with an action so sudden and a gesture of her right
hand so sweeping that the plate before her toppled and
fell with a crash to the floor. I noticed Mr. Hemster
instinctively grasp the tablecloth, but the girl marched
away as erect as a grenadier, her shapely shoulders
squared as if she was on military parade, and thus she
disappeared into the forward part of the ship. Miss
Stretton looked up at her employer, received a slight
nod, then she, with a murmur of excuse to me, rose and
followed the mistress of the ship. I heard a loud,
angry voice, shrill as that of a peacock, for a moment,
then a door was closed, and all was still. Mr. Hemster
said slowly to the captain:</p>

<p>“I’ll be up there in a minute and let you know
where we’re going. We’ve got all the time there is,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” said the captain, disappearing.</p>

<p>There was nothing to say, so I said nothing, and Mr.
Hemster and I sat out our lonely meal together. He
seemed in no way perturbed by what had taken place,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and as, after all, it was no affair of mine, even if my
unfortunate remark regarding the Mikado had been
the cause of it, I said inwardly there was little reason
for my disturbing myself about it. Although the old
gentleman showed no outward sign of inward commotion,
he nevertheless seemed anxious that our dismal
meal should draw to a speedy close, for he said to me
at last:</p>

<p>“If you wish for coffee, you can have it served to
you on deck.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said I, glad to avail myself of the opportunity
to escape. As I mounted the companion-way
I heard him say in firmer tones than I had known
him to use before:</p>

<p>“Tell my daughter to come here to me,”&mdash;a command
answered by the gentle “Yes, sir,” of the Japanese
boy.</p>

<p>I moved the wicker chair and table as far aft as
possible, to be out of earshot should any remarks follow
me from the saloon. I saw the captain on the
bridge again, pacing up and down, pipe in mouth and,
hands in pockets. Even at that distance I noticed on
his face a semi-comical grimace, and it actually seemed
to me that he winked his left eye in my direction. The
coffee did not come, and as I rose to stroll forward and
converse with the captain I could not help hearing the
low determined tones of the man down in the saloon,
mingled now and then with the high-pitched, angry
voice of the woman. As I hurried forward there next
came up the companion-way a scream so terrible and
ear-piercing that it must have startled every one on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
board, yet nobody moved. This was followed instantly
by a crash, as if the table had been flung over, which
of course was impossible, as it was fastened to the floor.
Then came the hysterical, terrifying half-scream, half-sob
of a woman apparently in mortal agony, and instinctively
I started down the companion-way, to be
met by Miss Stretton, who stretched her arms from
side to side of the stairway. The appealing look I
had noticed before was in her eyes, and she said in a
low voice:</p>

<p>“Please don’t come down. You can do no good.”</p>

<p>“Is anybody hurt?” I cried.</p>

<p>“No, nobody, nobody. Please don’t come down.”</p>

<p>I turned back, and not wishing to see the captain or
any one else at that moment, sat down in my chair
again. The sobs died away, and then Mr. Hemster
came up the companion-way with a determined look
on his face which seemed to me to say, “Women do not
rule after all.” Once on deck he shouted out to the
captain the one word:</p>

<p>“Corea!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> shouting of those three syllables was like
the utterance of a talismanic word in an
Arabian legend. It cleft the spell of inactivity
which hung over officers and crew as the sweep
of a scimitar cuts through the web of enchantment.
The silence was immediately broken by the agitated
snorting of a pony-engine, and the rattle of the anchor-chain
coming up. Then the melodious jingling of bells
down below told the engineer to “stand by.” As the
snort of the engine and the rattle of the chain ceased,
the crew mustered forward and began to stow the anchor.
Another jingle below, and then began the pulsating
of the engines, while the sharp prow of the
yacht seemed slowly to brush aside the distant hills and
set them moving. To a seasoned traveller like myself
there is something stimulating in the first throb of an
engine aboard ship. It means new scenes and fresh
experiences. Farewell Nagasaki and starvation; yes,
and sometimes despair. Yet I had a warm corner in
my heart for the old commercial city, with its queer
little picturesque inhabitants, whose keen eye for business
was nevertheless frequently softened by sentiment.</p>

<p>The man whose sharply uttered words had called up
commotion out of the stillness sank somewhat listlessly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
into his customary armchair, and put his feet, crossed,
on the rail. There was something in his attitude that
warned me he did not wish his privacy intruded upon,
so I leaned over the opposite rail and steadfastly regarded
the receding city. The big yacht moved
smoothly and swiftly over the waters of Nagasaki Bay,
which at that moment glittered dazzlingly in the sunlight.
The craft was evidently well engined, for the
vibration was scarcely perceptible, and somehow it
gave one the consciousness that there was a reserve of
power which might be called upon in a pinch. Once
clear of Nagasaki Bay the captain laid her course due
west, as if we were to race the declining sun. I surmised
that a safe rather than a quick voyage was his
object, and that he intended to strike through the Yellow
Sea and avoid threading the mazes of the Corean
Archipelago.</p>

<p>Long before the gong sounded for dinner we were
out of sight of land. As I went down the companion
stairs I must admit that I looked forward to the meal
with some degree of apprehension, hoping the atmosphere
would be less electric than during luncheon. I
need have harboured no fear; Mr. Hemster, the captain,
and myself sat down, but the ladies did not appear
during the meal. Mr. Hemster had little to say, but the
jovial captain told some excellent stories, which to his
amazement and delight I laughed at, for he had a
theory that no Englishman could see the point of any
yarn that ever was spun. Mr. Hemster never once
smiled; probably he had heard the stories before, and
in the middle of dinner (such seemed to be the captain’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
impolite habit) the story-teller rose and left us.
He paused with his foot on the first step, as he had
done before, turned to the owner, and said:</p>

<p>“No particular hurry about reaching Corea, is
there?”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Hemster shortly.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, sir, I don’t want to run down and
sink one of them there little islands in the Archipelago,
and have a suit for damages against me; so, unless
you’re in a hurry I propose to run a couple of hundred
miles west, and then north this side of the hundred-and-twenty-fifth
meridian.”</p>

<p>“Washington or Greenwich?” asked the owner.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said the captain with a smile, “I’m not
particular, so long as there’s a clear way ahead of me.
I once sailed with a Dutchman who worked on the
meridian of Ferro, which is the westernmost point of
the Canary Islands. When I am in home waters of
course I work by Washington, but the charts I’ve got
for this region is Greenwich, and so I say the hundred-and-twenty-fifth.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Hemster seriously. “I
thought you were too patriotic a man to use any
meridian but our own, and then I thought you were
so polite you were using Greenwich out of compliment
to Mr. Tremorne here. You pick out the meridian that
has the fewest islands along it and fewest big waves,
and you’ll satisfy me.”</p>

<p>The owner said all this quite seriously, and I perceived
he had a sense of humour which at first I had
not given him credit for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>The captain laughed good-naturedly and disappeared.
Mr. Hemster and I finished our dinner together
in silence, then went on deck and had coffee and
cigars. Although he proffered wine and liqueurs he
never drank any spirits himself. I was able to help
him out in that direction, as he once drily remarked.</p>

<p>It was one of the most beautiful evenings I had ever
witnessed. There was no breeze except the gentle current
caused by the motion of the yacht. The sea was
like glass, and as night fell the moon rose nearly at
the full. Mr. Hemster retired early, as I afterward
learned was his custom, but whether to work in his
office or to sleep in his bed I never knew. He seemed
to have no amusement except the eternal rolling of the
unlit cigar in his lips. Although there was a good library
on board I never saw him open a book or display
the slightest interest in anything pertaining to literature,
science, or art. This is a strange world, and in
spite of his undoubted wealth I experienced a feeling
of pity for him, and I have not the slightest doubt he
entertained the same feeling toward me.</p>

<p>I went forward after my employer left me, and asked
the captain if outsiders were permitted on the bridge,
receiving from him a cordial invitation to ascend. He
had a wooden chair up there in which he sat, tilted back
against the after rail of the bridge, while his crossed
feet were elevated on the forward one, and in this free
and easy attitude was running the ship. Of course
there was nothing calling for exceeding vigilance, because
the great watery plain, bounded by the far-off,
indistinct horizon, was absolutely empty, and the yacht<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
jogged along at an easy pace, which, as I have said,
gave one the impression that much power was held in
reserve. I sat on the forward rail opposite him, and
listened to his stories, which were often quaint and always
good. He had been a fisherman on the banks
of Newfoundland in his early days, and his droll characterization
of the men he had met were delicious to
listen to. From the very first day I admired the captain,
whose name I never learned, and this admiration
increased the more I knew of him. I often wonder if
he is still following the sea, and indeed I can never
imagine him doing anything else. He was able, efficient,
and resourceful; as capable a man as it was ever
my fortune to meet.</p>

<p>My interest in the captain’s stories came to an abrupt
conclusion when I saw a lady emerge from the companion-way,
look anxiously around for a moment, and
then begin a slow promenade up and down the after
deck. I bade good-night to the captain, and descended
from the bridge. The lady paused as she saw me approach,
and I thought for a moment she was about to
retreat. But she did not do so. I had determined to
speak to Miss Hemster on the first opportunity as if
nothing had occurred. Ill-will is bad enough in any
case, but nowhere is it more deplorable than on shipboard,
because people have no escape from one another
there. I was resolved that so far as I was concerned
there should not be a continuance of the estrangement,
which must affect more or less each one in our company,
unless it was the captain, who seemed a true philosopher,
taking whatever came with equal nonchalance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
As I neared the lady, however, I saw she was
not Gertrude Hemster, but Hilda Stretton.</p>

<p>“It is a lovely evening, Miss Stretton,” I ventured
to say, “and I am glad to see you on deck to enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“I came up for a breath of fresh air,” she replied
simply, with no enthusiasm for the loveliness of the
night, which I had just been extolling. I surmised instinctively
that she preferred to be alone, and was inwardly
aware that the correct thing for me to do was
to raise my yachting-cap and pass on, for she had evidently
come to a standstill in her promenade, to give
me no excuse for joining it. But, whether or not it
was the glamour of the moonlight, her face was much
more attractive than it had seemed when, for the first
time, I had had a glimpse of it, and, be that as it may,
I say this in excuse for my persistence. When has a
young man ever been driven from his purpose by the
unresponsiveness of the lady he is bold enough to address?</p>

<p>“If you do not mind, Miss Stretton, I should be very
much gratified if you would allow me to join your
evening saunter.”</p>

<p>“The deck belongs as much to you as it does to me,”
was her cold rejoinder, “and I think I should tell you
I am but the paid servant of its actual owner.”</p>

<p>I laughed, more to chase away her evident embarrassment
than because there was anything really to
laugh about. I have noticed that a laugh sometimes
drives away restraint. It is the most useful of human
ejaculations, and often succeeds where words would
fail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>“A warning in exchange for your warning!” I
exclaimed as cheerfully as I could. “I, too, am a paid
servant of the owner of this yacht.”</p>

<p>“I did not expect to hear the cousin of Lord Tremorne
admit as much,” she replied, thawing somewhat.</p>

<p>“Well, you have just heard the cousin of his lordship
do so, and I may add on behalf of Lord Tremorne
that if he were in my place I know his candour would
compel him to say the same thing.”</p>

<p>“Englishmen think themselves very honest, do they
not?” she commented, somewhat ungraciously, it
seemed to me, for after all I was trying to make conversation,
always a difficult task when there is veiled
opposition.</p>

<p>“Oh, some Englishmen are honest, and some are
not, as is the case with other nationalities. I don’t
suppose a dishonest Englishman would have any delusions
about the matter, and perhaps if you pressed him
he would admit his delinquency. I hope you are not
prejudiced against us as a nation; and, if you are, I
sincerely trust you will not allow any impression you
may have acquired regarding myself to deepen that
prejudice, because I am far from being a representative
Englishman.”</p>

<p>We were now walking up and down the deck together,
but her next remark brought me to an amazed
standstill.</p>

<p>“If you possess the candour with which you have
just accredited yourself and your people, you would
have said that you hoped I was not prejudiced against
your nation, but you were certain, if such unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
was the case, the charm of your manner and the
delight of your conversation would speedily remove it.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Miss Stretton,” I cried, “do you
take me for a conceited ass?”</p>

<p>The lady condescended to laugh a little, very low and
very sweetly, but it was an undeniable laugh, and so I
was grateful for it.</p>

<p>“You mistake me,” she said. “I took you for a
superior person, that was all, and I think superior persons
sometimes make mistakes.”</p>

<p>“What mistake have I fallen into, if you will be so
good as to tell me?”</p>

<p>“Well, as a beginning, Mr. Tremorne, I think that
if I was an English lady you would not venture to accost
me as you have done to-night, without a proper
introduction.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. I considered myself introduced
to you by Miss Hemster to-day at luncheon;
and if our host had not so regarded it, I imagine he
would have remedied the deficiency.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemster, with a delicacy which I regret to say
seems to be unappreciated, knowing me to be a servant
in his employ, did not put upon me the embarrassment
of an introduction.”</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Stretton, I find myself compelled to
talk to you rather seriously,” said I, with perhaps a
regrettable trace of anger in my voice. “You show
yourself to be an extremely ignorant young woman.”</p>

<p>Again she laughed very quietly.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, with an exultation that had
hitherto been absent from her conversation; “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
veneer is coming off, and the native Englishman stands
revealed in the moonlight.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right, the veneer is coming off.
And now, if you have the courage of your statements,
you will hear the truth about them. On the other
hand, if you like to say sharp things and then run
away from the consequences, there is the saloon, or
there is the other side of the deck. Take your choice.”</p>

<p>“I shall borrow a piece of English brag and say I
am no coward. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I came down from the bridge after a
most friendly and delightful talk with the captain, having
no other thought in my mind than to make myself
an agreeable comrade to you when I saw you on deck.”</p>

<p>“That was a very disingenuous beginning for a
truthful lecture, Mr. Tremorne. When you saw me,
you thought it was Miss Hemster, and you found out
too late that it was I; so you approached me with the
most polite and artful covering of your disappointment.”</p>

<p>We were walking up and down the deck again, and
took one or two turns before I spoke once more.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Stretton, you are demoniacally right. I
shall amend the beginning of my lecture, then, by alluding
to an incident which I did not expect to touch
upon. At luncheon Miss Hemster received my greeting
with what seemed to me unnecessary insolence.
We are to be housed together for some time aboard
this yacht; therefore I came down to greet her as if
the incident to which I have alluded had not taken
place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>“How very good of you!” said Miss Stretton sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Madam, I quite agree with you. Now we will
turn to some of your own remarks, if you don’t mind.
In the first place, you said I would not address an English
lady to whom I had not been properly introduced.
In that statement you were entirely wrong. Five
years ago, on an Atlantic liner, I, without having been
introduced, asked the Countess of Bayswater to walk
the deck with me, and she graciously consented.
Some time after that, the deck steward being absent,
her Grace the Duchess of Pentonville, without a formal
introduction to me, asked me to tuck her up in
her steamer chair; then she requested me to sit down
beside her, which I did, and we entered into the beginning
of a very pleasant acquaintance which lasted during
the voyage.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said Miss Stretton, evidently unimpressed,
“how fond you are of citing members of the
nobility!”</p>

<p>“Many of them are, or have been, friends of my
own; so why should I not cite them? However, my
object was entirely different. If I had said that Mrs.
Jones or Mrs. Smith were the people in question, you
might very well have doubted that they were ladies,
and so my illustration would have fallen to the ground.
You said English ladies, and I have given you the
names of two who are undoubtedly ladies, and undoubtedly
English, for neither of them is an American
who has married a member of our nobility.”</p>

<p>If ever fire flashed from a woman’s eyes, it was upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
this occasion. Miss Stretton’s face seemed transformed
with anger.</p>

<p>“Sir!” she flashed, “that last remark was an insult
to my countrywomen, and was intended as such. I
bid you good-night, and I ask you never to speak to me
again.”</p>

<p>“Exactly as I thought,” said I; “the moment shells
begin to fly, you beat a retreat.”</p>

<p>Miss Stretton had taken five indignant steps toward
the companion-way when my words brought her to
a standstill. After a momentary pause she turned
around with a proud motion of her figure which elicited
my utmost admiration, walked back to my side, and
said very quietly:</p>

<p>“Pardon me; pray proceed.”</p>

<p>“I shall not proceed, but shall take the liberty of
pausing for a moment to show you the futility of jumping
to a conclusion. Now, try to comprehend. You
said, <em>English</em> ladies. My illustration would have been
useless if the Countess and the Duchess had been
Americans. Do you comprehend that, or are you too
angry?”</p>

<p>I waited for a reply but none came.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you further,” I went on, “that I know
several American women who possess titles; and if
any man in my presence dared to hint that one or other
of them was not a lady I should knock him down if I
could, and if no one but men were about. So you see
I was throwing no disparagement on your countrywomen,
but was merely clenching my argument on the
lines you yourself had laid down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>“I see; I apologize. Pray go on with the lecture.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the permission, and on your part
please forgive any unnecessary vehemence which I
have imported into what should be a calm philosophical
pronouncement. When you accuse an Englishman of
violating some rule of etiquette, he is prone to resent
such an imputation, partly because he has an uneasy
feeling that it may be true. He himself admits that
nearly every other nation excels his in the arts of
politeness. It is really not at all to his discredit that
he fondly hopes he has qualities of heart and innate
courtesy which perhaps may partly make up for his
deficiency in outward suavity of manner. Now,
madam, etiquette is elastic. It is not an exact science,
like mathematics. The rules pertaining to decimal
fractions are the same the world over, but the etiquette
of the Court differs from the etiquette of the drawing-room,
and dry-land etiquette differs from the etiquette
on board ship.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why it should,” interrupted Miss Stretton.</p>

<p>“Then, madam, it shall be my privilege to explain.
Imagine us cast on a desert shore. If, for instance,
our captain were less worthy than he is, and ran us
on the rocks of Quelpaerd Island, which is some distance
ahead of us, you would find that all etiquette
would disappear.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why? Because we should each have to turn
around and mutually help the others. Whether I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
been introduced to you or not, I should certainly endeavour
to provide you with food and shelter; whereas
if I contracted one of the island’s justly celebrated
fevers, your good heart would prompt you to do what
you could for my restoration. Now a ship is but a
stepping-stone between the mainland of civilization and
the desert island of barbarism. This fact, unconsciously
or consciously, seems to be recognized, and so
the rules of etiquette on board ship relax, and I maintain,
with the brutal insistance of my race, that I have
not infringed upon them.”</p>

<p>“I think that is a very capital and convincing illustration,
Mr. Tremorne,” confessed the lady generously.</p>

<p>Now, look you, how vain a creature is man. That
remark sent a glow of satisfaction through my being
such as I had not experienced since a speech of my
youth was applauded by my fellow-students at the
Union in Oxford. Nevertheless, I proceeded stubbornly
with my lecture, which I had not yet finished.</p>

<p>“Now, madam, I am going to give you the opportunity
to charge me with inconsistency. I strenuously
object to the application of the term ‘servant’ as applied
to yourself or to me. I am not a servant.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Tremorne, you admitted it a while ago,
and furthermore said that your distinguished cousin
would also have confessed as much if in your place.”</p>

<p>“I know I said so; but that was before the veneer
fell away.”</p>

<p>“Then what becomes of the candour of which you
boasted? Has it gone with the veneer?”</p>

<p>“They are keeping each other company on the ocean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
some miles behind us. I have thrown them overboard.”</p>

<p>Miss Stretton laughed with rather more of heartiness
than she had yet exhibited.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” she cried; “this is a transformation
scene, all in the moonlight!”</p>

<p>“No, I am not Mr. Hemster’s servant. Mr. Hemster
desires to use my knowledge of the Eastern languages
and my experience in Oriental diplomacy.
For this he has engaged to pay, but I am no more his
servant than Sir Edward Clark is a menial to the client
who pays him for the knowledge he possesses; and,
if you will permit me the English brag, which you
utilized a little while since, I say I am a gentleman and
therefore the equal of Mr. Silas K. Hemster, or any one
else.”</p>

<p>“You mean superior, and not equal.”</p>

<p>“Madam, with all due respect, I mean nothing of
the sort.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, that is what is in your mind and in
your manner. By the way, is your lecture completed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, entirely so. It is your innings now. You
have the floor, or the deck rather.”</p>

<p>“Then I should like to say that Silas K. Hemster,
as you call him, is one of the truest gentlemen that
ever lived.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that his name?”</p>

<p>“You were perfectly accurate in naming him, but
you were certainly supercilious in the tone in which
you named him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I say!”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t; it is <em>my</em> say, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly; but at first you try to make
me out a conceited ass, and now you endeavour to show
that I am an irredeemable cad. I have the utmost respect
for Mr. Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Have you? Well, I am very glad to hear it, and I
wish to give you a firmer basis for that opinion than
you have been able to form from your own observation.
Mr. Hemster may not be learned in books, but he is
learned in human nature. He is the best of men, kind,
considerate, and always just. He was a lifelong friend
of my father, now, alas, no more in life. They were
schoolboys together. It was inevitable that Mr. Hemster
should become very wealthy, and equally inevitable
that my father should remain poor. My father was a
dreamy scholar, and I think you will admit that he
was a gentleman, for he was a clergyman of the Episcopal
Church. He was not of the money-making order
of men, and, if he had been, his profession would have
precluded him from becoming what Mr. Hemster is.
Although Mr. Hemster grew very rich, it never in the
least interfered with his friendship for my father nor
with his generosity to my father’s child. If I cared to
accept that generosity it would be unstinted. As it is,
he pays me much more than I am worth. He is simple
and honest, patient and kind. Patient and kind,” she
repeated, with a little tremor of the voice that for a
moment checked her utterance,&mdash;“a true gentleman,
if ever there was one.”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Stretton,” I said, “what you say of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
him is greatly to the credit of both yourself and Mr.
Hemster; but it distresses me that you should intimate
that I have failed to appreciate him. He has picked
me up, as I might say, from the gutters of Nagasaki
without even a line of recommendation or so much as
a note of introduction.”</p>

<p>“That is what I said to you; he is a judge of men
rather than of literature and the arts; and it is entirely
to your credit that he has taken you without credentials.
You may be sure, were it otherwise, I should not have
spent so much time with you as I have done this evening.
But his quick choice should have given you a
better insight into his character than that which you
possess?”</p>

<p>“There you go again, Miss Stretton. What have
I said or done which leads you to suppose I do not regard
Mr. Hemster with the utmost respect?”</p>

<p>“It is something exceedingly difficult to define. It
cannot be set down as lucidly as your exposition of
etiquette. It was your air, rather than your manner
at luncheon time. It was a very distant and exalted
air, which said as plainly as words that you sat down
with a company inferior to yourself.”</p>

<p>I could not help laughing aloud; the explanation was
absolutely absurd.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear Miss Stretton, if I may call you so,
you never even glanced at me during luncheon time;
how, then, did you get such extraordinary notions into
your head?”</p>

<p>“One did not need to glance at you to learn what I
have stated. Now, during our conversation you have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
been frightened&mdash;no, that is not the word&mdash;you have
been surprised&mdash;into a verbal honesty that has been
unusual to you. Please make the confession complete,
and admit that in your own mind you have not done
justice to Mr. Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Miss Stretton, the word you have been searching
for is ‘bluff.’ I have been bluffed into confessions,
before now, which in my calmer moments I regretted.
You see I have been in America myself, and ‘bluff’ is
an exceedingly expressive word. And, madam, permit
me to say that in this instance the bluff will not work.
You cannot get me to admit that either by look or tone
I think anything but what is admirable of Mr. Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, oh, dear!” cried the girl in mock despair.
It was really wonderful how unconsciously friendly
she had become after our tempestuous discussion.
“Oh, dear, oh, dear! how you are fallen from the state
of generous exaltation that distinguished you but a
short time ago. Please search the innermost recesses
of your mind, and tell me if you do not find there something
remotely resembling contempt for a man who
accepted you&mdash;appalling thought!&mdash;without even a
note of introduction.”</p>

<p>“Very well, my lady, I shall make the search you
recommend. Now we will walk quietly up and down
the deck without a word being said by either of us,
and during that time I shall explore those recesses of
my mind, which no doubt you regard as veritable
‘chambers of horrors.’”</p>

<p>We walked together under the bridge, and then to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the very stern of the ship, coming back to the bridge
again. As we turned, the lady by my side broke the
contract.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried with a little gasp, “there is Miss
Hemster!”&mdash;and I saw the lady she mentioned emerge
from the companion-way to the deck.</p>

<p>“Damnation!” I muttered, under my breath, forgetting
for an instant in whose presence I stood, until she
turned her face full upon me.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I beg your pardon most sincerely,” I stammered.</p>

<p>“And I grant it with equal sincerity,” she whispered,
with a slight laugh, which struck me as rather remarkable,
for she had previously become deeply offended at
sayings much milder than my surprised ejaculation.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> were sailing due west, so that the full
moon partly revealed the side face of the
figure approaching us, and I venture to
assert that the old moon, satellite of lovers, never
shone upon anything more graceful than the vision we
now beheld. Man as I was, I knew intuitively that she
was dressed with a perfection far beyond my powers
of description. The partly revealed face wore an expression
of childlike simplicity and innocence, with all
of a mature woman’s exquisite beauty. No frowns
now marred that smooth brow; the daintily chiseled
lips were animated by a smile of supreme loveliness.</p>

<p>“What a perfectly enchanting night!” she cried, as
she came to a standstill before us. “But don’t you
think it is a trifle chilly?”&mdash;and a slight shiver vibrated
her frame. “But I suppose you have been energetically
walking, and therefore have not noticed the
change of temperature. Oh, Hilda, darling, would you
mind running down to my room and bringing up that
light fleecy wrap, which I can thrown over my
shoulders?”</p>

<p>“I will bring it at once,” replied Miss Stretton, hastening
toward the companion-way. Just as she reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the head of the stair a ripple of tinkling laughter added
music to the night.</p>

<p>“Dear me, how stupid I am!” cried Miss Hemster,
“Why, Hilda, I have it here on my arm all the time!
Don’t bother, darling!”</p>

<p>Miss Stretton paused for a moment, then said,
“Good-night!” and disappeared down the stairway.</p>

<p>Man is a stupid animal. I did not know at the moment,
nor did I learn until long after,&mdash;and even then
it was a lady who told me,&mdash;that this was a sweet dismissal,
as effective as it was unperceived by myself.</p>

<p>Miss Hemster busied herself with the fleecy wrap,
whose folds proved so unmanageable that I ventured
to offer my aid and finally adjusted the fabric upon her
shapely shoulders. We began walking up and down
the deck, she regulating her step to mine, and, in the
friendly manner of yesterday afternoon, placing her
hand within my arm.</p>

<p>However, she did not hop and skip along the deck
as she had done on the streets of Nagasaki, although I
should have thought the smooth white boards offered
an almost irresistible temptation to one who had shown
herself to be bubbling over with the joy of youth and
life. Notwithstanding the taking of my arm, she held
herself with great dignity, her head erect and almost
thrown back, so I expected to be treated to a new phase
of her most interesting character. I was finding it
somewhat bewildering, and hardly knew how to begin
the conversation; but whether it was the springing
step, or the smoothness of the deck, or both combined,
it struck me all at once that she must be a superb<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
dancer, and I was about to make inquiry as to this when
she withdrew her hand rather quickly after we had
taken two or three turns up and down the deck in
silence, and said:</p>

<p>“You are not taking advantage of the opportunity
I have been kind enough to present to you.”</p>

<p>“What opportunity?” I asked in amazement.</p>

<p>“The opportunity to apologize to me.”</p>

<p>“To apologize?” cried I, still more at a loss to understand
her meaning. “Pray, for what should I apologize?”</p>

<p>She said with great decision and some impatience:</p>

<p>“How terribly dense you Englishmen are!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I admit it. We are celebrated as a nation for
obtuseness. But won’t you take pity on this particular
Englishman, and enlighten him regarding his offence.
What should I apologize for?”</p>

<p>“Why, you told my father you were not a friend of
the Mikado!”</p>

<p>“Certainly I told him so. I am not a friend of the
Mikado; therefore why should I claim to be?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, with a fine gesture of disdain,
“you are trying to do the George Washington act!”</p>

<p>“The George Washington act!” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Of course you don’t see that. He could
not tell a lie, you know.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I understand you. No, I am doing the Mark
Twain act. I can tell a lie, but I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Not even for me?” she asked, looking up at me
with that winning smile of hers.</p>

<p>“Ah, when you put it that way I fear I shall be unable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
to emulate the truthfulness of either George or
Mark.”</p>

<p>“Now that isn’t so bad,” she said, taking my arm
again, which gave me the hope that I had been at least
partially restored to favour.</p>

<p>“You certainly intimated to me yesterday that you
were a friend of the Mikado.”</p>

<p>“Then I am to blame; for with equal certainty I
had no right to do so.”</p>

<p>“You said you had seen him several times and had
spoken with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that does not constitute a claim upon His
Majesty’s consideration.”</p>

<p>“Why, you have only seen me two or three times,
and I am sure you know I’m a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“Madam, I am delighted to hear you say so. If the
Mikado had made a similar statement, I should claim
him as a friend before all the world.”</p>

<p>“Then there was another thing you said, and I suppose
you’ll go back on that, too. You said you were a
partisan of mine, or, since you are such a stickler for
accuracy, an adherent&mdash;I think that was the word&mdash;yes,
you were my adherent, or retainer, or something
of the sort, such as we read of in old-fashioned novels,
and when you said so, poor little trustful girl that I am,
I believed you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Miss Hemster, you had every right to do
so. Should occasion arise, you will find me your
staunch defender.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all very pretty; but when it comes to
the test, then you fail. You heard what my father said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
You must have known I meant you to claim friendship
with the Mikado. Poor father’s as transparent as
glass, and he surely made it as plain as this funnel that
I wished you to claim friendship with the head of the
Japanese nation. So, after all your beautiful promises,
the moment you get a chance to back me up, you do so
by going back on me.”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Hemster, why did you not give me
a hint of your wishes? If, when we were in Nagasaki,
you had but said that you wished me to proclaim myself
the Emperor’s brother, I should have perjured
myself on your behalf like a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“It happened that I was not on deck when you came
aboard, and so did not see you. But I do think, if you
hadn’t forgotten me entirely, you would have learned
at once from my father’s talk what I wished you to
say.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see it all now, when it is too late; but as you
have remarked, and as I have admitted, I am extremely
dense, and unless a thing is as plain as the funnel&mdash;to
use your own simile&mdash;I am very apt to overlook it.
Sometimes I don’t see it even then. For instance,
when you are walking by my side, I am just as likely to
run into the funnel as to walk past it.”</p>

<p>She laughed most good naturedly at this observation,
and replied:</p>

<p>“Oh, you do say things very charmingly, and I will
forgive you, even if you refuse to apologize.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t refuse to apologize. I <em>do</em> apologize&mdash;most
abjectly&mdash;for my stupidity.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that’s all right. Perhaps, when everything’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
said and done, it was my own fault in not giving
you warning. Next time I want you to stand by
me, I’ll have it all typewritten nice and plain, and will
hand the paper to you twenty-four hours ahead.”</p>

<p>“That would be very kind of you, Miss Hemster;
and, besides, you would then possess documentary evidence
of the stupidity of an Englishman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t need to have documentary evidence
for that,” she replied brightly; “but I tell you I was
mad clear through when I knew what you had said to
my father. I raised storm enough to sink the yacht.”</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I? Why, you <em>knew</em> I did.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t the slightest suspicion of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you are denser than I thought. And I
have been worrying myself all the afternoon for fear
you were offended by the way I told you to take your
seat at the table.”</p>

<p>“Offended? I shouldn’t have had the presumption
to think of such a thing. Indeed, it was very kind of
you to indicate my place. Such instructions are usually
given by the steward.”</p>

<p>She bestowed a sly, sidelong glance upon me, and
there was a somewhat uncertain smile at the corners of
her pretty lips.</p>

<p>“Is that a little dig at me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort. It was a mere statement of
fact.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think,” she said meditatively, more to
herself than to me, “that you are not such a fool as
you look.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>I was compelled to laugh at this, and replied with as
much urbanity as I could call to my command:</p>

<p>“I am overjoyed to hear that statement. It seems
to prove that I am making progress. Such evidence
always encourages a man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” she said, with a shrug of impatience,
“don’t let’s talk any more about it. I didn’t want to
go to Corea, and I <em>did</em> want to return to Yokohama;
so here we are going to Corea. Don’t you think I am
a very good-natured girl to let bygones be bygones so
easily?”</p>

<p>“You certainly are.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s settled. Tell me what Miss Stretton
was talking to you about.”</p>

<p>I was somewhat taken aback by this extraordinary
request, but replied easily:</p>

<p>“Oh, we had not been walking the deck very long,
and we discussed nothing of extreme importance so far
as I can remember.”</p>

<p>“What did she say about me?”</p>

<p>“I assure you, Miss Hemster, your name was not
mentioned between us.”</p>

<p>“Really? Then what on earth <em>did</em> you talk about?”</p>

<p>“When I have the good fortune to be in your presence,
Miss Hemster, I confess it seems impossible that
I should talk about anyone else than yourself, nevertheless
I should not presume to discuss one lady with
another.”</p>

<p>The girl jerked away her arm again, and turned to
me with a flash in her eyes that was somewhat disconcerting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Tremorne,” she cried, “if you’ve
got anything to say against me, I want you to say it
right out like a man, and not to hint at it like a spiteful
woman.”</p>

<p>“What have I said now?” I inquired very humbly.</p>

<p>“You know quite well what you have said. But if
you imagine I am as stupid as you admit yourself to be,
you’ll get left!”</p>

<p>“My dear madam,” I ventured; “one of the advantages
of having a thick skin is that a person does not
take offence where no offence is meant.”</p>

<p>“There you go again! You know very well that
you were driving at me when you said that you refused
to discuss one lady with another; because, if you
meant anything at all, you meant that I was trying to
do what you couldn’t bring yourself to do; and when
you talk of ‘lady’ and ‘lady’ you are in effect putting
Miss Stretton on an equality with me.”</p>

<p>“I should never think of doing so,” I replied, with a
bow to the angry person beside me.</p>

<p>“Is that another?” she demanded. “Oh, you know
very well what I mean. Do you consider Miss Stretton
a lady?”</p>

<p>“My acquaintance with her is of the shortest, yet I
should certainly call her a lady.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you call me?”</p>

<p>“A lady also.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t putting us on an equality, what
is?”</p>

<p>“I said, madam, that <em>I</em> did not put you on an equality.
That was done by a celebrated document which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
you often fling in our faces. I refer to the Declaration
of Independence, which, if I remember rightly,
begins&mdash;‘All men are created equal,’ and I suppose,
as the humourist puts it, that the men embrace the
women.”</p>

<p>“Miss Stretton is my paid servant,” insisted Miss
Hemster, evading the point; “and, as was said in the
opera of ‘Pinafore,’ when one person has to obey the
orders of another, equality is out of the question.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think that made any difference in the
United States.”</p>

<p>“But this isn’t the United States.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but this is the United States.
We are on the high seas, aboard a steamer that is registered
in New York, and so this deck is just as much a
part of your country as is New York itself, and the
laws of the United States would justify the captain in
putting me in irons if he thought my conduct deserved
such treatment.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse to tell me what you and Miss
Stretton were discussing!”</p>

<p>“My dear madam, if Miss Stretton asked me what
you and I were discussing, I should certainly refuse to
inform her. Should I not be justified in doing so? I
leave it to yourself. Would you be pleased if I repeated
our conversation to Miss Stretton?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know that I should mind,” replied
Miss Hemster mildly, the storm subsiding as quickly as
it had risen; “I have no doubt she told you that her
father was a clergyman, and that my father had borrowed
five hundred dollars from her father to get his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
start in life. And she doubtless hinted that her father
was the founder of our fortune.”</p>

<p>“I assure you, Miss Hemster, that she said nothing
at all about five hundred dollars or any other sum. She
spoke mostly of your father, and she spoke very highly
of him.”</p>

<p>“She certainly had every right to do so. My father
gave her what education she has and supported her
ever since.”</p>

<p>I made no comment upon this statement, and my
companion veered round a bit and said brightly:</p>

<p>“Oh, I see you don’t like me to talk like that, and
perhaps I shouldn’t, but Hilda Stretton is as sly as
they make them, and I’ve no doubt she came on deck
just to size you up, while you would never suspect it.”</p>

<p>“I venture to think you do the young lady an injustice,
Miss Hemster. I am sure she would have preferred
to walk the deck alone, although she was too
polite to say so. I rather fear I forced my company
upon her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, oh, yes; I understand all about that. Such
is just the impression Hilda Stretton would like to
make upon a man. Now I am honest. I came on deck
purposely to have a talk with you.”</p>

<p>“Then I am very much flattered.”</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to be, and I may say this for you,
that you don’t talk to me in the least as other men do.
Nobody has ever dared to contradict me.”</p>

<p>“Have I done so? You shock me, for I certainly
did not intend to contradict you.”</p>

<p>“Why, you have done nothing else, and I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
think it’s gentlemanly at all. But we’ll let that go.
Now I wish to talk about yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think we might choose a more entertaining
topic.”</p>

<p>“We’ll talk about Lord Tremorne then.”</p>

<p>“Hang Lord Tremorne!”</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Stretton and you were discussing him
then?”</p>

<p>“Indeed we were not, but I am rather tired of the
gentleman. Yet he is a very good fellow, and I ought
not to say ‘Hang him!’ even if I am on the high seas.
I am sure I wish him nothing but good.”</p>

<p>“If he were to die, would you become Lord Tremorne?”</p>

<p>“Bless me, no!”</p>

<p>“Who stands between you?”</p>

<p>“His three sons, who are very healthy specimens of
humanity, I am glad to say.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there ever any possibility of your becoming
Lord Tremorne, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a possibility of anything, but no probability.
I may say quite truthfully that no one would
be so sorry as I if the probability occurred.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to have a title?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t give twopence for it.”</p>

<p>“Really? I thought every one in England wanted
a title?”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no! There are men in England, plain
Mr. This or That, who wouldn’t change their appellation
for the highest title that could be offered them.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, they belong to fine old families and look upon
the newer aristocracy as upstarts.”</p>

<p>“It seems funny to talk of old families, for all families
are the same age. We all spring from Adam, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless, but I believe the College of Arms does
not admit such a contention.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think family pride a very idiotic
thing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. To tell you the truth, I haven’t
thought very much about it, though I don’t see why
we should parade the pedigree of a horse and be
ashamed of the pedigree of a man.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the same thing. A horse may have notable
ancestors, whereas I am told that most of your aristocracy
sprang from thieves and outlaws.”</p>

<p>“As far as that goes, some of them are still in the
pirate profession, those who belong to the public companies,
for example,&mdash;bogus companies, I mean. I
suppose, after all said and done, that the pedigree of
even the oldest family in Europe is as nothing to that
of the Eastern Kings, for this King of Corea that we
are going to see traces his ancestry about as far back
as did Pooh-Bah.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there will be any trouble in getting
to see his Corean Majesty?” Miss Hemster asked with
a shade of anxiety in her tone.</p>

<p>“I am not at all sure, for the etiquette of the Corean
Court is very rigid. A horseman must dismount when
he is passing the Palace, although it is but a ramshackle
conglomeration of shabbiness. Every one admitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
to the Presence must prostrate himself before
the King.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shan’t do it,” said the girl confidently.</p>

<p>“I hope to obtain a relaxation of the rule in the case
of a Princess like yourself, Miss Hemster. If his Majesty
should graciously touch your hand, the law of
Corea demands that ever afterward you must wear a
badge as token of the distinction conferred upon you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall just wear another ring with the arms of
Corea on it,&mdash;that is, if Corea has arms,”&mdash;said Miss
Hemster with vivacity. “I am sure it is very good of
you to take all this trouble for us. And now I must
bid you good-night and thank you for the very pleasant
walk we have had together.”</p>

<p>With that my lady withdrew her bright presence and
disappeared down the companion-way.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I awoke</span> next morning after a sweet and dreamless
sleep that was almost inspiring. Months
and months had passed since I slept in a European
bed, and, although necessity had accustomed
me to the habit of a Japanese mat upon the floor and
a block of wood for a pillow, I must confess that the
bed of the West still seemed to me a very paradise of
luxury. There were more patent contrivances about
that yacht than I have ever seen in such small compass
before. Of course it had electric lights everywhere.
There was a water-condensing machine, an ice-making
machine, and all the usual fittings that now go to the
construction of a luxurious steamer for sailing in warm
latitudes. There was a bathroom which was Oriental in
its splendour and Occidental in its patent fittings. One
could have any sort of bath that one desired. By simply
turning a handle on a dial the great marble basin
became filled with water at any temperature indicated
by the figures at which you set the pointer, from
boiling-hot to ice-cold. This was indeed a delight, and
when I came to it from my room in dressing-gown
and slippers I found the Japanese boy there with a cup
of delicious tea such as can be had only in the immediate
vicinity of China. On a dainty plate whose figure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
work was only partially obscured by a filmy lace napkin
were some finger-lengths and finger-widths of buttered
toast. “Rupert, my boy,” I said to myself, “you
have indeed fallen upon your feet!”</p>

<p>I now knew that I was going to have the pleasantest
voyage of my life. The clouds which yesterday threatened
to obscure my acquaintance with Miss Hemster
had cleared away, and although I had surmised that
the young woman was somewhat quick to take offence
when one approached the confines of either ridicule or
criticism, yet I was well aware that no man has a right
to inflict conversation that is distasteful upon any
woman, and I thought I had sufficient power over my
speech to prevent further errors in that direction. A
most unaccustomed sense of elation filled me, and, as I
tossed about my wardrobe, I came across a pair of Oxford
bags that I had not worn for years. As they were
still spotlessly white, I put them on, with a blazer
which gave to the world the somewhat glaring colors
of my college, and, thus gloriously arrayed with cap on
head, I almost imagined myself about to stroll along
the High, once more an extremely young man.</p>

<p>My costume made quite a sensation at the breakfast-table,
and caused great laughter on the part of our
worthy captain, who said the only thing it reminded
him of was a clown in Barnum’s circus. Miss Hemster
was good enough to compliment the outfit, and,
after the meal was over, did me the honour of strolling
up and down the deck for nearly an hour, after which
she disappeared below. Silas K. Hemster occupied his
customary place on deck in the wicker armchair, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
after his daughter had deserted me I stood beside him
for a few moments, endeavouring to engage him in
conversation, but soon saw that he preferred his own
thoughts, for which preference, to be sure, I could find
no fault with him, for anything I had to say was
neither novel nor entertaining. I was about to go
below and select a book from the rather extensive
library when there met me at the head of the companion-way
the notes of the very subdued playing of one of
Chopin’s most charming nocturnes. I paused for a
moment at the head of the stair, then descended softly,
saying to myself that Miss Hemster was a most accomplished
musician.</p>

<p>Perhaps I have not stated that at the farther end of
the saloon from the foot of the stairs stood an excellent
piano, and at the stairway end an equally fine American
organ. As I descended I soon saw that the musician
was Miss Stretton, who sat with her back
toward me, playing with a touch I have seldom heard
equalled even by professionals. I am very fond of
music, so I slipped quietly into a chair and listened to
those divine harmonies divinely played. Miss Stretton
went on from nocturne to nocturne, and I felt somewhat
guilty at thus surreptitiously listening, but resolved
that the moment she gave a sign of ceasing I
would steal quietly up the stair again without revealing
my presence.</p>

<p>Down the passage facing me, that formed a highway
from the saloon to the suites occupied by the ladies,
I saw Miss Hemster come out of her room, and,
by the same token, she must have seen me. She advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
a few steps, then stood still, apparently listening
to the music, finally turned, and re-entered her
apartment with a distinct, emphatic slam of the door.
I paid no attention to this, but then was the time for
me to steal on deck again if I had had any wisdom in
my head, which I so frequently must admit I have not.
Miss Stretton, absorbed in the music, presumably had
not heard the slam of the door, but a little later Miss
Hemster emerged again, and this time came straight
down the passage and through the saloon, with a
swish, swish of silken skirts that sounded eloquent in
anger. I have never heard silk skirts rustle since then
without remembering the occasion I am endeavouring
to describe; yet never before or since have I heard the
hiss of silk that actually swore, if I may be permitted
the use of such an expression.</p>

<p>The young woman marched past me with head erect,
and a gleam in her eyes such as I had seen on one
occasion before, but this time fixed and anything but
transient, as the other flash had been. I rose respectfully
to my feet as she passed, but she cast not even a
glance at me, merely pausing for a second at the foot
of the stairs to catch up the train of her magnificent
gown, then up the steps she went at a run. Now I had
consciously given the girl no cause of annoyance, but,
the music having ceased suddenly, I turned around and
saw Miss Stretton regarding me with something like
dismay in her eyes.</p>

<p>“How long have you been here?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, only for a few minutes,” I replied. “Pray go
on, Miss Stretton. I am very fond of music, and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
for years have I been privileged to hear it so well
played.”</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you to say that,” murmured
Hilda Stretton, “but I think I have played enough for
one morning.”</p>

<p>“At least finish the selection you were just now engaged
upon,” I begged.</p>

<p>“Some other time, please,” she said in a low voice;
and I did not urge her further, for I saw she was
frightened.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I replied, “I shall take that as a
promise.”</p>

<p>She inclined her head as she came down the room,
and went up the stairs, disappearing also on deck, leaving
me wondering what all this disquietude was about.
I thought of going on deck myself, but, feeling slightly
resentful at the treatment accorded me by Miss Hemster,
I walked forward, sat down on the piano-stool,
and began to drum a few of the catchy London tunes
that ran through my head. I was playing “Knocked
’em in the Old Kent Road” with little idea of how excellent
an overture it would prove for the act about
to be commenced, and was thinking of the Strand,
and the Tivoli, and Chevalier, and Piccadilly Circus,
and the Empire, and Leicester Square, and the Alhambra,
when I was startled by a woman’s appealing voice
crying just above a whisper:</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, Gertie; please don’t!”</p>

<p>I turned my head and saw, coming down the stairway,
Gertrude Hemster followed by Hilda Stretton.
The latter was evidently almost on the verge of tears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
but the face of the former was shocking to behold. I
could not have believed that a countenance so beautiful
was capable of being transformed into a visage that
might have stood model for a picture of murderous
wrath.</p>

  <div class="captionr"><a href="#Page_95"><i>Page 95</i></a>
</div></div>

<p>“Will you stop your foolish pounding on <em>my</em>
piano?” she cried, with a tremendous emphasis on the
first personal pronoun.</p>

<p>“Madam, I have stopped,” I replied, giving a soft
answer that failed to have the supposed effect.</p>

<p>“I guess you think you own the yacht and all it contains,
don’t you? Now, I beg to inform you that we
don’t allow employees to conduct themselves as if they
were in a bar-room or a drinking-saloon.”</p>

<p>As she said this, she strode once up and down the
length of the room.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I, “I beg your pardon, and shall
never touch your piano again. My only excuse is that
I have been so accustomed to public liners, where the
piano is free to all, that for the moment I forgot
myself.”</p>

<p>At this juncture Miss Stretton was so injudicious as
to touch the other on the elbow, apparently trying to
guide her into the passage that led to her room, but
Miss Hemster whirled around like an enraged tigress,
and struck her companion a blow that would have
landed on her cheek had not the victim suddenly and
instinctively raised an arm to protect her face. Then
with the viciousness of a harridan of Drury Lane Miss
Hemster grasped the shrinking girl by the shoulders,
and shook her as a terrier does a rat, finally forcing her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
down into a seat by the side of the table. One girl’s
face was as white as paper, and the other’s nearly purple
with rage. I had intended to go up on deck, but
paused for two reasons. First I was afraid of injury
to Miss Stretton, and secondly the struggle took
place, if struggle it could be called when one was
entirely passive, in the midst of the only route open
to me.</p>

<p>“You dare to interfere, you little fool,” shrieked
Miss Hemster. “You that are the cause of all the
trouble, with your silly little ditties&mdash;tinkle-tinkle-tinkle-tinkle&mdash;and
I’ll box your ears for you if you
dare stir!”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I, “you are possibly so ignorant as
not to know that you were listening to Chopin’s most
subtle harmonies.”</p>

<p>This had exactly the effect I desired, which was to
turn her away from the trembling girl whom she had
so harshly misused.</p>

<p>“Ignorant, you puppy! Have you the gall to apply
such language to me, looking, as you do, like a monkey
on a stick; like a doll that one can buy at the bargain
counter.”</p>

<p>This graphic description of my Oxford blazer was
so striking that in spite of the seriousness of the case I
did the one thing I should not have done,&mdash;I laughed.
The laugh was like a spark to a powder-mine, and
what made the crisis worse was that the old gentleman
in his armchair on deck, hearing the shrieking voice,
came down, his face haggard with anxiety.</p>

<p>“Gertie, Gertie!” he cried. I would not like to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
say the young lady swore, but she came so near it that
there was but tissue paper between the expression she
used and that which an angry fish-wife would have
employed. With the quickness of light she sprang at
a large Japanese vase which temporarily decorated the
center of the table. This she heaved up, and with the
skill of a football player flung it squarely at me. Now,
I have had some experience on the football field myself,
and I caught that vase with a dexterity which
would have evoked applause had any enthusiast of the
game happened to be present. I suppose my placing of
this huge vase on the top of the piano was the last
straw, or perhaps it was her father coming forward,
crying in a grief-shaken voice, “Oh, Gertie, Gertie,
my child, my child!”</p>

<p>I was so sorry for him that I passed him and would
have gone on deck out of the way, but my purpose was
checked by a startling incident. The young woman
had whisked open a drawer. I heard it come clattering
to the floor, for she had jerked it clear from its place;
then there was a scream. Turning quickly around I
met the blinding flash of a pistol, and heard behind me
the crash of a splintering mirror. The sound of the
revolver in that contracted space was deafening, and
even through the smoke I saw that my young friend
was about to fire again. I maintain it was not fear for
my own life that caused instant action on my part, but
this infuriated creature, who seemed to have become
insane in her anger, faced three helpless, unarmed
people, and whatever was to be done had to be done
quickly. I leaped through the air, and grasped her two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
wrists with an energetic clutch I daresay she had never
encountered before.</p>

<p>“Drop that revolver!” I cried.</p>

<p>“Let go my wrists, you beast,” she hissed in my
face. For answer I raised her arms and brought them
down with a force that would have broken her fingers
with the weight of the revolver if she had not let it go
clattering to the floor.</p>

<p>“You beast, you beast, you beast!” she shrieked at
me, as well as her choking throat would allow utterance.
I swung her around a quarter-circle, then
pushed her back, somewhat rudely I fear, until she
sank down into a chair.</p>

<p>“Now, sit there and cool,” I cried, giving her a
hearty shake, so that she should know how it felt herself.
“If you don’t keep quiet I’ll box your ears.”</p>

<p>I don’t defend my action at all; I merely state that
I was just as angry as she was, and perhaps a little
more so.</p>

<p>“You brute, let go of my wrists! I’ll kill you for
this! Hilda, call the captain and have this man put in
irons. Father, how can you stand there like a coward
and see a beastly ruffian use me in this way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Gertie, Gertie!” repeated the father without
moving.</p>

<p>She now burst into a passionate flood of tears, and I
released her wrists, ready, however, to catch them
again if she made any motion to reach the revolver.</p>

<p>During this fierce if brief contest,&mdash;it took less time
in happening than it requires in telling,&mdash;Miss Stretton
had been seated in the chair upon which the angry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
woman had thrust her, and she gazed at us in open-eyed
terror. The old man stood half leaning against
the table, steadying himself with his hands. Miss
Hemster’s fit of weeping was as dramatic as everything
else she did. It began with a burst of very angry
and genuine tears, and this storm passed through a
gamut of more or less varying emotions until it subsided
into a hysterical half-sobbing, half-gasping wail
which resembled the cry of the helpless child who had
been tyrannized over. It was bogusly pathetic, but I
saw it went straight to the old man’s heart and wrung
it with very real agony, and this mean advantage which
I knew she was taking of the father’s deep love for her
increased my scornful contempt for the creature. His
grief was actual enough, and she was quite consciously
playing upon it, although,&mdash;wonderful actress that she
was,&mdash;she pretended an utter abandon of heart-breaking
sorrow.</p>

<p>As for me, I undoubtedly felt myself the brute she
had named me, and even at that moment,&mdash;much more
so later,&mdash;was shocked to find in my own nature
depths of primeval savagery which had hitherto been
unsuspected. Seeing, however, that the worst of the
storm was over, and that the young woman would
make no more attempts at gun-firing, I replaced the
drawer in position and threw into it its scattered former
contents. Then I picked up the revolver, saying:</p>

<p>“I will keep this, for there is nothing more dangerous
than such an instrument in the hands of a woman
who can’t shoot.”</p>

<p>The effect of this remark on the drooping figure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
was instantaneous. She abruptly raised her tear-sodden
face, which now became crimson with a new
wave of anger.</p>

<p>“You gaping baboon,” she cried, “I can shoot a
great deal better than you can!”</p>

<p>I paid no heed to her, but, advising Mr. Hemster to
lock up any other firearms he might have on board,
abruptly left the saloon.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I walked</span> the deck alone, the revolver stuck between
my hip and my gaudy sash, as if I were a
veritable pirate, and doubtless my appearance
was not dissimilar to some of those nautical heroes who
have been terrors of the sea. A pirate more dissatisfied
with himself never trod a quarter-deck. If there
had been a plank at hand I would willingly have walked
it. It was no comfort that I despised the girl, for I
despised myself a thousand times more. What right
had I to interfere? Why had I not bowed to her when
she ordered me away from the piano, and come at once
on deck, without proffering any of my foolish explanations?
The whole disgraceful row had arisen through
my contemptible efforts to justify a situation which allowed
of no justification. The piano was hers, as she
truly said, and I had no more right to touch it than I
had to wear her jewellery. My sole desire at first was
to get ashore as soon as anchor was dropped, and never
again see either father or daughter. But a few moments’
reflection showed me the quandary into which I
had brought myself. I was already indebted to the
old gentleman, not only for the money he had advanced
to me, but for his kindness from the very first, which I
had repaid by an interference in his family affairs that
made me loathe myself. Never before had I felt so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
acutely the sting of poverty. Not even in my starvation
days at Nagasaki had my lack of means borne so
heavily upon me. It was utterly impossible for me to
refund a penny of the pounds he had so generously bestowed
upon me. The only requital in my power was
that of honest service to him, and now I had made my
stay on the yacht impossible, when, had I retained a
modicum of sanity at the proper moment, I might have
withdrawn with no loss of dignity. Now my own self-respect
was gone, and I had more than justified every
bitter taunt she flung at me.</p>

<p>So, in a very hopeless state of misery and dejection,
I walked up and down the deck until Mr. Hemster himself
came quietly up the companion-way and took his
usual place in his wicker chair, setting his heels upon
the rail in front of him, and biting off the end of a
cigar. He gave me no greeting, but this also was usual
with him, and so it meant nothing one way or another.
However, I had at last made up my mind on a course
of action, so I strode over to where he sat, and he
looked up at me with what I took to be more of apprehension
than censure in his gaze. It was no matter of
wonder to me that he must be seriously doubting his
wisdom in taking on board without recommendation a
stranger who had just proved himself such a brawler.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemster,” said I, “an apology is a cheap
method of trying to make amends for what is inexcusable;
but I should like to tell you, and I should like
you to believe, how sorry I am for my conduct of a
short time since. I regret to say it is impossible for
me to return the money you have advanced. When I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
first had the pleasure of meeting you, I stated to you
quite truthfully that I was at the end of my resources,
and of course my prospects have not improved in the
mean time, except in so far as your own favour is concerned,
and that, I quite realize, I have forfeited.
From this time until we sight land, I shall live forward
with the crew in the forecastle, and shall not again come
aft except in obedience to your orders. When we
reach Corea I am entirely at your disposal. If you
wish me to carry out the project you have in hand, I
shall do so to the best of my ability; if not, I give you
my word I will refund to you the money as soon as I
can earn it.”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said very quietly, and when I had
done so he remained silent, gazing over the rail at the
distant horizon for what seemed to me a very long
time. Then he spoke, never raising his voice above the
level at which he always kept it.</p>

<p>“You are a little excited just now,” he said, “and
take an exaggerated view of the matter. Do you think
any one on deck heard that pistol-shot?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I rather imagine not. No one
seemed at all on the alert when I came up.”</p>

<p>“Well, it sounded as if it would raise all creation
down below, but perhaps it didn’t make such a racket
up here. Now, if you went forward and lived with the
crew, what would be the effect? They would merely
say we made it impossible for you to live aft. I suppose
by rights I shouldn’t mind what my crew thinks or
says; but I do mind it. We are in a way a small
democracy afloat, one man as good as another. If the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
firing were heard on deck, then the captain will be joking
about it at luncheon time, and we’ll know. If it
wasn’t, the least said about it the better. If you don’t
like to come to meals, I haven’t a word to say; you
can have them served in your own room. As for the
money I advanced, that doesn’t amount to anything. I
am sure you are just the man I want for what there is
to do, and when that’s done it will be me that’s owing
you money. I’m a good deal older than you, and I
have found that in business a man must keep his temper,
or he’s going to give all his adversaries a great
advantage over him, and things are cut so close nowadays
that no one can afford to give points to his rival.
I’ve had to control my temper or be a failure, so I controlled
it. My daughter hasn’t had to do that. Instead
of blaming her, you should blame me. It’s my
temper she’s got.”</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Hemster, I assure you I am blaming
neither of you; I am blaming myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right. It’s a good state of Christian
feeling and won’t do you any harm. Now you
said that when we land you are willing to do anything
I ask. Are you willing to do that before we go
ashore?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Hemster, any command you may lay
upon me I shall execute without question.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t lay a command on you at all; but I
ask as a favour that you go below, knock at my daughter’s
door, and tell her you are sorry for what has happened.
Put it any way you like, or don’t do it at all
if you don’t want to. After all, she is a woman, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
know. You and I are men, and should stand the brunt,
even if we are not entitled to it, and it may make things
go a little smoother, perhaps.”</p>

<p>We are supposed to be an unemotional race, but I
confess that the old man’s mild words touched me
deeply, and made it next to impossible for me to reply
to him. But, even so, my own judgment told me that
a life of this desire to make things go smoothly had resulted
in building up a character in his daughter which
took an obstreperous advantage of the kindly old gentleman’s
strong affection for her. I arose without a
word, thrust forward my hand to him, which he shook
somewhat shamefacedly, glancing nervously around,
fearing there might be onlookers. I entirely appreciated
his reserve, and wished for a moment that I had
not acted upon my impulse, to his visible embarrassment.
I went instantly to the saloon, along the passage,
and knocked at the door of Miss Hemster’s apartment.
She herself opened the door, with what seemed
to me to be her usual briskness; but when I looked at
her, I saw her drooping like a stricken flower, head
bent, and eyes on the floor. Scarcely above a whisper,
she asked with tremor-shaken voice:</p>

<p>“Did you wish to see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Hemster,” I replied, nerving myself to
the point. “I wish, since you are good enough to receive
me, to apologize most abjectly for my rudeness
to you this morning.”</p>

<p>She replied in a sad little voice, without looking up:</p>

<p>“I do not really mind in the least how much you
play the piano, Mr. Tremorne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>This was so unexpected a remark, so ludicrously
aside from the real point at issue between us, so far
from touching the hideousness of my culpability, that
I looked at the girl, wondering whether or not she was
in earnest. I had not come to get permission to play
the piano. Her attitude, to which no other word than
“wilted” so appropriately applied, continued to be one
of mute supplication or dependence. Yet in the semi-darkness
I fancied I caught one brief glance at my face.
Then she leaned her fair head against the jam of the
door and began to cry very softly and very hopelessly.</p>

<p>I stood there like the awkward fool I was, not knowing
what to say; and finally she completed my desolation
by slowly raising her two arms up toward my face.
Since our contest she had removed the striking costume
she then wore, and had put on a white lace fleecy
garment that was partly dressing-gown, partly tea-gown,
decorated with fluttering blue ribbon. This
had very wide sleeves which fell away from her arms,
leaving them bare and rounded, pure and white. Her
two slender, shapely hands hung in helpless fashion
from the wrists like lilies on a broken stem. The slow
upraising of them seemed to me strange and meaningless,
until the light from the inner room fell upon her
wrists, and then the purport of her action became stunningly
clear to me. Around that dainty forearm, delicately
fashioned for the tenderest usage, showed red
and angry the marks of my brutal fingers, silent accusers
held up before my very eyes. Distraught as I was
with self-accusation, I could not help admiring the
dramatic effectiveness of the slow motion and resulting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
attitude. The drooping girl, with her soft, clinging
draperies, her sad face so beautiful, her contour so perfect,
and those soft appealing hands upraised,&mdash;hands
that I could not forget had been placed with impulsive
friendliness in mine on the streets of Nagasaki,&mdash;and
all this accompanied by the almost silent symphony of
quivering sobs that were little louder than sighs tremulously
indrawn, formed a picture that has never been
effaced from my memory. I had rather a man’s
clenched fist had struck me to the ground than that a
woman’s open palm should be so held in evidence
against me. I regard that moment as the most unbearable
of my life, and with a cry almost of despair
I turned and fled. For once language had become impossible
and utterly inadequate.</p>

<p>As I beat this precipitate retreat, was it my over-wrought
imagination, or was it actual, that I heard an
indignant word of expostulation, followed by a low
sweet ripple of laughter. Had there been some one
else in the room during this painful interview? I
staggered like a drunken man up to the deck, and then
endeavoured to walk it off and cease thinking.</p>

<p>Mr. Hemster said nothing to me that day, nor I to
him, after I came on deck again. For an hour I strode
the deck with an energy which, if applied in the right
direction, would have driven the yacht faster than she
was going. When the gong sounded for luncheon I
went down to my own room and was served there.
After the meal I did not go up on deck again, but sat
on the sofa gloomily smoking. Later I got a novel
from the library, and tried to interest myself in it, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
failed. I felt physically tired, as if I had done a hard
day’s work, and, unsentimental as it is to confess it, I
fell asleep on the sofa, and slept until the gong for dinner
aroused me.</p>

<p>Dinner I also enjoyed in solitary state in my own
apartment, then, under the brilliant cluster of electric
lights, tried the novel again, but again without success.
The nap in the afternoon made sleep improbable
if I turned in, so I scarcely knew what to do with myself.
I rather envied Silas K. Hemster’s reticence, and
his seeming dislike for intercourse with his fellows.
He was the most self-contained man I had ever met,
preferring the communion of his own thoughts to conversation
with any one. At this crisis of indecision the
way was made plain for me by the youth from Japan.
There came a gentle tap at my door, and on opening
it the Japanese boy said respectfully:</p>

<p>“Sir, Miss Stretton would like to speak with you on
deck.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I had</span> flung my much-maligned blazer into a corner,
and now I slipped on an ordinary tweed
coat. I found the deck empty with the exception
of Miss Stretton, who was walking up and down
in the moonlight, as she had done the night before,
but this time she came forward with a sweet smile
on her lips, extending her hand to me as if we had
been old friends long parted. There was something
very grateful to me in this welcome, as I was beginning
to look upon myself as a pariah unfit for human
companionship. Indeed, I had been bitterly meditating
on striking into the Corean wilderness and living
hereafter as one of the natives, about the lowest ambition
that ever actuated the mind of man.</p>

<p>“Have you sentenced yourself to solitary imprisonment,
Mr. Tremorne?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t you think I deserve it?”</p>

<p>“Frankly, I don’t; but as you did not appear at
either luncheon or dinner, and as the Japanese boy who
brought my coffee up here told me you were keeping to
your room, I thought it as well to send for you, and I
hope you are not offended at having your meditation
broken in upon. Prisoners, you know, are allowed
to walk for a certain time each day in the courtyard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
I do wish I had a ball and chain for your ankles, but
we are on board ship, and cannot expect all the luxuries
of civilization.”</p>

<p>Her raillery cheered me more than I can say.</p>

<p>“Miss Stretton, it is more than good of you to receive
an outcast in this generous manner.”</p>

<p>“An outcast? Please don’t talk rubbish, Mr. Tremorne!
Somehow I had taken you for a sensible person,
and now all my ideas about you are shattered.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder at it,” I said despondently.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you are in the Slough of Despond, and
I am trying to pull you out of it. When I remember
that men have ruled great empires, carried on important
wars, subdued the wilderness, conquered the ocean,
girdled the earth with iron, I declare I wonder where
their brains depart to when they are confronted with
silly, whimpering, designing women.”</p>

<p>“But still, Miss Stretton, to come from the general
to the particular, a man has no right to ill-treat a
woman.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you; but, as you say, to come to
this particular incident which is in both our minds, do
you actually believe that there was ill-treatment?
Don’t you know in your own soul that if the girl had
received treatment like that long ago she would not
now be a curse to herself and to all who are condemned
to live within her radius?”</p>

<p>“Yet I cannot conceal from myself that it was none
of my business. Her father was present, and her correction
was his affair.”</p>

<p>“Her correction was any one’s affair that had the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
courage to undertake it. What had you seen? You
had seen her strike me, and thrust me from her as if I
were a leper. Then you saw this girl with the temper
of the&mdash;the temper of the&mdash;oh, help <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Temper of the devil,” I responded promptly.</p>

<p>“Thank you! You saw her take up a deadly
weapon, and if she has not murdered one of the three
of us, we have to thank, not her, but the mercy of God.
You did exactly the right thing, and the only thing,
and actually she would have admired you for it had
it not been that you came down to her door and prostrated
yourself for her to trample over you.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Miss Stretton! were you inside that
room?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter whether I was or not. I know
that she twisted you around her little finger, and took
her revenge in the only way that was possible for her.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you don’t know the depth of my degradation.
She showed me her wrists, marked by the fingers
of a savage, and that savage was myself.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! pooh! pooh!” cried Miss Stretton, laughing.
“Do you think those marks indicate pain? Not a
bit of it. Your grasp of her wrists did not injure her in
the least, and, short of putting handcuffs on them, was
the only method at your disposal to prevent her perhaps
killing her father, a man worth a million such as
she, and yet neither he nor you have the sense to see it.
I can inform you that Miss Gertrude’s arm is sore to-night,
but not where you clasped it. She hurt herself
more than she injured me when she struck me. Look
at this,”&mdash;and she drew back her sleeve, disclosing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
wrist as pretty as that of Miss Hemster, notwithstanding
the fact that one part was both bruised and swollen.
“That is where I caught her blow, and can assure you
it was given with great force and directness. So, Mr.
Tremorne, if you have any sympathy to expend, please
let me have the benefit of it, and I will bestow my sympathy
upon you in return.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Miss Stretton, I am very sorry to see that
you are hurt. I hoped you had warded off the blow
slantingly, instead of getting it square on the arm like
that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is nothing,” said the girl carelessly, drawing
down her sleeve again, “it is merely an exhibit,
as they say in the courts, to win the sympathy of a man,
and it doesn’t hurt now in the least, unless I strike it
against something. I ask you to believe that I would
never have said a word about the girl to you if you had
not seen for yourself what those near her have to put
up with. You will understand, Mr. Tremorne, I am
but a poor benighted woman who has had no one to
talk to for months and months. I cannot unburden
my soul to Mr. Hemster, because I like him too well;
and if I talk to the captain he will merely laugh at me,
and tell funny stories. There is no one but you; so
you see, unfortunate man, you are the victim of two
women.”</p>

<p>“I like being the victim of one of them,” said I;
“but am I to infer from what you have said that, as
you don’t speak to Mr. Hemster because you like him,
you speak to me because you dislike me?”</p>

<p>“What a far-fetched conclusion!” she laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
“Certainly not. I like you very much indeed, and
even admired you until you used the word ‘abjectly’
down in that passage. That is a word I detest; no
one should employ it when referring to himself.”</p>

<p>“Then you <em>were</em> in Miss Hemster’s room after all.”</p>

<p>“I have not said so, and I refuse to admit it. That
is hereafter to be a forbidden topic, and a redeemed
prisoner in charge of his gaoler must not disobey orders.
If it were not for me, you would now be in your
room moping and meditating on your wickedness. I
have wrestled with you as if I were a Salvation lass,
and so you should be grateful.”</p>

<p>“Never was a man wallowing in despondency more
grateful for the helping hand of a woman enabling him
to emerge.”</p>

<p>“It is very generous of you to say that, when it
was the helping hand of a woman that pushed you
into it.”</p>

<p>“No, it was my own action that sent me there. I
doubt if a man ever gets into the Slough of Despond
through the efforts of any one else. A lone man
blunders blindly along, and the first thing he knows
he is head over ears in the mud,&mdash;and serve him
right, too.”</p>

<p>“Why serve him right?”</p>

<p>“Because he has no business being a lone man.
Two heads are better than one; then, if one is making
for the ditch, the helping hand of the other restrains.”</p>

<p>“Since when did you arrive at so desperate a conclusion,
Mr. Tremorne?”</p>

<p>“Since I met you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it is a blessing there was no one to restrain
you to-day, or otherwise somebody might have been
shot. There is something to be said for lack of restraint
upon occasion.”</p>

<p>“Miss Stretton, if I had had a sensible woman to
advise me, I am certain I would never have lost my
money.”</p>

<p>“Was it a large amount?”</p>

<p>“It was a fortune.”</p>

<p>“How one lives and learns! I have often heard that
women squander fortunes, but never yet that a woman
helped to preserve one.”</p>

<p>“It is better for a man’s wife to squander a fortune
than to allow a stranger to do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not so sure. The end seems to be the
same in both cases. I suppose you have in your mind
the woman who would have given you good advice at
the proper time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you ask her now, or is it too
late?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that she would have anything to do
with me; however, it is very easy to find out. Miss
Stretton, will you marry me? I have nothing particular
to offer you except myself, but I think I’ve reached
the lowest ebb of my fortunes, and any change must be
toward improvement.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, is this actually a proposal?”</p>

<p>“If you will be so generous as to regard it as such.”</p>

<p>The young lady stopped in her promenade, and
leaned back against the rail, looking me squarely in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the face. Then she laughed with greater heartiness
than I had yet heard her do.</p>

<p>“This is most interesting,” she said at last, “and
really most amazing. Why, you must have known me
for nearly two hours! I assure you I did not lend
you a helping hand out of the Slough of Despond
to imprison you at once in the Castle Despair of a
penniless marriage. Besides, I always thought a proposal
came after a long and somewhat sentimental
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">camaraderie</i>, which goes under the name of courtship.
However, this explains what I have so often marvelled
at in the English papers; a phrase that struck
me as strange and unusual: ‘A marriage has been arranged
and will take place between So-and-So and
So-and-So.’ Such a proposal as you have just made is
surely an arrangement rather than a love affair. Indeed,
you have said nothing about love at all, and so
probably such a passion does not enter into the amalgamation.
If you were not so serious I should have
thought you were laughing at me.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, madam, I am very much in earnest,
and it is you who are laughing at me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think I’ve a very good right to do so?
Why, we are hardly even acquainted, and I have no
idea what your Christian name is, as I suppose you
have no idea what mine is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Hilda, I know your name perfectly!”</p>

<p>“I see you do, and make use of it as well, which
certainly advances us another step. But the other half
of my proposition is true, and I remain in ignorance of
yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>“When unconsciously I went through the ceremony
of christening, I believe my godfathers and godmothers
presented me with the name of Rupert.”</p>

<p>“What a long time you take in the telling of it.
Wasn’t there a Prince Rupert once? It seems to me
I’ve heard the phrase ‘the Rupert of debate,’ and the
Rupert of this, and the Rupert of that, so he seems to
be a very dashing fellow.”</p>

<p>“He was. He dashed into misfortune, as I have
often done, but there all likeness between us ends.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me the likeness remains, because the
present Rupert is dashing into the misfortune of a very
heedless proposal. But do not fear that I shall take
advantage of your recklessness, which is the more dangerous
when you remember my situation. I sometimes
think I would almost marry the Prince of Darkness to
get out of the position I hold, for I am told he is a
gentleman, who probably keeps his temper, and I am
coming to the belief that a good temper is a jewel beyond
price. However, I’m exaggerating again. I do
not really need to stay here unless I wish it, and I remain
for the sake of Mr. Hemster, who, as I told you
last night, has always been very kind to me, and for
whom I have a great respect and liking. Besides, I am
not nearly so helpless as perhaps you may imagine. If
I went home I could make a very good living teaching
music in the States. So you see I do not need
to accept the Prince of Darkness should he offer his
hand.”</p>

<p>“You mean, <em>when</em> he has offered his hand?”</p>

<p>She laughed at this, and went on merrily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>“No, ‘if;’ not ‘when.’ I shall always cherish the
proposal of Prince Rupert, and when the Prince of
Darkness makes advances I shall probably tell him that
he is not the first Highness so to honour me. When
the sunlight comes to take the place of the moonlight,
we shall laugh together over this&mdash;I can’t call it sentimental
episode, shall we term it, business arrangement?
Now, would you mind accepting a little advice
on the subject of matrimony?”</p>

<p>“I’ll accept your advice if you’ll accept me. Turn
about is fair play, you know. Let us finish one transaction
before we begin another.”</p>

<p>“Transaction is a charming word, Mr. Tremorne,
nearly as good as arrangement; I am not sure but it
is better. I thought the transaction was finished.
You are respectfully declined, with thanks, but, as I
assured you, I shall always cherish the memory of this
evening, and, now that the way is clear, may I tender
this advice, which I have been yearning for some hours
to give you. You won’t reply. Well, on the whole I
think your attitude is very correct. You could hardly
be expected to jump joyously from one transaction to
another, and I really feel very much flattered that you
have put on that dejected look and attitude, which
becomes you very much indeed and almost makes me
think that the precipitancy of my refusal equals the
headlong impetuosity of your avowal. A wiser woman
would have asked time for consideration.”</p>

<p>“Pray take the time, Miss Stretton; it is not yet too
late.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. What is done, is done, and now comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
my advice. You said two heads are better than one.
That is true generally, but not always, so I shall present
you with an aphorism in place of it, which is that two
purses are better than one, if either contains anything.
If one purse is always empty, and the other is bursting
full, the truth of my adage cannot be questioned. I
surmise that your purse and mine are almost on an
equality, but I can assure you that Miss Hemster’s
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">portemonnaie</i> is full to repletion.”</p>

<p>“That has nothing to do with me,” I answered
curtly.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it may have, and much. I noticed when
you came down to luncheon yesterday that you are
very deeply in love with Miss Hemster.”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Hilda,&mdash;I claim the right to call you
that,&mdash;when one remembers that you never took your
eyes from your plate at luncheon I must say that you
have most extraordinary powers of observation. You
thought I was high and mighty toward Mr. Hemster,
which was not the case, and now you assert that I was
in love with Miss Hemster, which is equally beside the
fact.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are bound to say that, and I may
add that although I am offering you advice I am not
asking confidences in exchange. I assert that you fell
in love with Miss Hemster during your charming ramble
through Nagasaki; falling in love with a haste
which seems to be characteristic of you, and which totally
changes the ideas I had previously held regarding
an Englishman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a number of your notions concerning the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
of my country were entirely erroneous, as I took the
liberty of pointing out to you last night.”</p>

<p>“So you did, but actions speak louder than words,
and I form my conclusions from your actions. Very
well, propose to Miss Hemster; I believe she would
accept you, and I further believe that you would prove
the salvation of the girl. Her father would make no
objection, for I see he already likes you; but in any
case he would offer no opposition to anything that his
daughter proposed. His life is devoted, poor man, to
ministering to her whims and caprices, so you are
certain of the parental blessing, and that would carry
with it, as I have pointed out, the full purse.”</p>

<p>“You spoke of the Prince of Darkness just now,
Miss Stretton, so I will appropriate your simile and
say that if there were an unmarried Princess of Darkness
I would sooner try my luck with her than with
Miss Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense! Miss Hemster is a good-hearted
girl if only she’d been rightly trained. You would
tame her. I know no man so fitted to be the modern
Petruchio, and I am fond enough of the drama to say
I would like to see a modern rendering of ‘The Taming
of the Shrew.”</p>

<p>“She’ll never be tamed by me, Miss Stretton.”</p>

<p>“She has been, Mr. Tremorne, only you spoiled your
lesson by your apology. You must not make a mistake
like that again. If you had stood your ground, preserving
a distant and haughty demeanour, with a frown
on your noble brow, pretty Miss Gertrude would soon
have come around to you, wheedling, flattering, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
most exquisitely charming, as she well knows how to
be. You could then have caught her on the rebound,
as the novels put it, just, in fact, as I have managed to
catch you to-night. You will be very thankful in the
morning that I refused to retain my advantage.”</p>

<p>“I shall never be thankful for that, Miss Hilda, and
it is equally certain that I shall never propose to Miss
Hemster. If I were a speculative adventurer I’d venture
to wager on it.”</p>

<p>“Most men who see her, propose to her; therefore
you must not imagine that Gertrude has not been
sought after. I should not be at all certain of your
success were it not that every man she has hitherto met
has flattered her, while you have merely left the marks
of your fingers on her wrists and have threatened to
box her ears. This gives you a tremendous advantage
if you only know how to use it. I have read somewhere
that there is a law in Britain which allows a husband
to punish his wife with a stick no bigger than his
little finger. I therefore advise you to marry the girl,
take something out of the full purse and buy back the
ancestral acres, then go into the forest and select a
switch as large as the law allows. After that, the new
comedy of ‘The Taming of the Shrew,’ with the married
pair living happily ever afterward. You should
prove the most fortunate of men, in that you will possess
the prettiest, richest, and most docile wife in all
your island.”</p>

<p>“I am not a barrister, Miss Stretton, therefore can
neither affirm nor deny the truth you have stated regarding
the law of the stick. If, however, a belief in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
that enactment has led you to reject my proposal, I beg
to inform you that I have no ancestral acres containing
a forest; therefore I cannot possess myself of a
twig of the requisite size without trespassing on some
one else’s timber. So you see you need have no fear on
that score.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure,” replied Hilda, shaking her pretty
head, “I imagine there must be a Wife-Beaters’
Supply Company in London somewhere, which furnishes
the brutal Britisher at lowest rates with the correct
legal apparatus for matrimonial correction. I
tremble to think of the scenes that must have been enacted
in the numerous strong castles of Britain which
have had new copper roofs put on with the money
brought over by American brides. Girls, obstreperous
and untrained, but wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice,
have gone across, scorning the honest straightforward
American man, who in my opinion is the most
sincere gentleman of all the world. These rich but
bad-tempered jades have disappeared within the castle,
and the portcullis has come down. Have we ever
heard a whimper from any one of them? Not a whisper
even. If they had married American men there
would have been tremendous rows, ending with divorce
cases; but not so when they have disappeared
into the castle. You never hear of an American
woman divorcing a lord, and Lord knows some of
those lords are the riff-raff of creation. History gives
us grim pictures of tragical scenes in those old strongholds,
but I shudder to think of the tragedies which
must occur nowadays when once the drawbridge is up,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
and the American girl, hitherto adored, learns the law
regarding flagellation. The punishment must be exceedingly
complete, for the lady emerges cowed and
subdued as the Kate that Shakespeare wrote about.
And how well that great man understood a wilful and
tyrannical woman! Oh, you needn’t look shocked,
Mr. Tremorne. Haven’t you an adage on that benighted
island which says ‘A woman, a dog, and a
walnut-tree; the more you beat them the better they
be?’”</p>

<p>“Great heavens, girl, what an imagination you
have! You should really write a novel. It would be
an interesting contribution toward international love
affairs.”</p>

<p>“I may do so, some day, if music-teaching fails. I
should like, however, to have the confession of one of
the victims of an international matrimonial match.”</p>

<p>“Which victim? The English husband or the
American wife?”</p>

<p>“The wife, of course. I think I shall wait until you
and Miss Hemster are married a year or two, and then
perhaps she will look more kindly on me than she does
at present, and so may tell me enough to lend local
colour to my book.”</p>

<p>“I can give you a much better plan than that, Miss
Stretton. Hearsay evidence, you know, is never admitted
in courts of law, and by the same token it
amounts to very little in books. I am given to understand
that, to be successful, an author must have lived
through the events of which he writes, so your best
plan is to accept my offer; then we will purchase a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
moated grange in England, and you can depict its
horrors from the depths of experience.”</p>

<p>“Where are we to get the money for the moated
grange? I haven’t any, and you’ve just acknowledged
that you are penniless.”</p>

<p>“I forgot that. Still, moated granges are always
going cheap. They are damp as a general rule, and
not much sought after. We could possibly buy one on
the instalment plan, or even rent it if it came to that.”</p>

<p>Miss Stretton laughed joyously at the idea, held out
her hand, and bade me a cordial good-night.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much, Mr. Tremorne for a most interesting
evening, and also for the proposal. I think it
very kind of you, for I suppose you suspect I haven’t
had very many. I think we’ve each helped the other
out of the Slough of Despond. So good-night, good-night!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I was</span> awakened next morning by the roar of the
anchor-chain running out, and found the yacht
at a standstill, with the vibration of the machinery
temporarily at an end. On looking out through
the porthole I recognized the town of Chemulpo, which
had grown considerably since I last saw it. Beyond
stood the hills of Corea, rising wave upon wave, as if
the land had suffered a volcanic eruption.</p>

<p>Mr. Hemster and I had breakfast alone together,
after which we went on deck.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “the captain has brought us safely
here without running down an island, and the next
move in the game is yours. What do you propose
to do?”</p>

<p>“I shall go ashore at once, engage ponies and an
escort, change a quantity of silver money into ropes of
sek, then I shall make my way as quickly as possible
to the capital.”</p>

<p>“What are ropes of sek?” asked Mr. Hemster.</p>

<p>“They are bronze, iron, or copper coins, which are
strung on ropes of straw by means of a square hole in
the middle. They are the most debased currency on
earth, and are done up in strings of five hundred cash.
Sek is useful in dealing with the natives, but when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
come to the capital I shall need silver and gold. When
I have made arrangements at Seoul I shall return to
Chemulpo and let you know the result.”</p>

<p>“You told me I could not take the ‘Michigan’ up
the river,&mdash;what do you call it,&mdash;the Han?&mdash;and you
were doubtful about the advisability of using the
naphtha launch.”</p>

<p>“No, the yacht would be sure to run aground before
you had gone very far, and as for the naphtha launch,
the Han is rather a treacherous and very crooked piece
of navigation, and if you had to stop half-way we
might be farther from the capital than we are now,
with a worse road ahead of us, and no chance of getting
ponies or escort. I strongly advise you to stay
where you are till I return, and meanwhile I’ll find out
more about the river than I know now.”</p>

<p>To this Mr. Hemster agreed, and, being well provided
with the sinews of war, I went ashore. Chemulpo
proved to be quite a commercial town, and there
was no difficulty in my getting everything I wanted. I
was shocked but not surprised to find that the Prime
Minister, whom I formerly knew, and on whose help
I had somewhat counted, had been deposed and beheaded,
while all his relatives, male and female, had
been eliminated from human knowledge by death,
slavery, or exile. However, even if this man had remained
in office, my best plea with him would have
been money, and as I was well provided with this necessity
I foresaw no obstacle to my purpose. Having
had an early start, and pushing on with more energy
than my escort relished, in spite of my promises of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
recompense, I reached the capital before the great bell
rang and the gates were closed.</p>

<p>I had some thought of calling on the British representative,
and if I had done so would doubtless have
enjoyed better accommodation for the night than fell
to my lot; but as, the last time I saw him, I was, like
himself, a servant of our Government, I could not
bring myself to acknowledge that I was now merely
the hired man of an American millionaire, as his
daughter had so tersely put it.</p>

<p>Next day I very soon bribed my way to the presence
of the then Prime Minister, and was delighted to find
in him a certain Hun Woe, whom I had previously
known in a very much more subordinate capacity. After
our greetings I went straight to the point, and told
Hun Woe that I represented a gentleman and his
daughter, now at Chemulpo, who wished the honour of
a private conference with the Emperor. I also mentioned
casually that there was a certain amount of
money in this for the Prime Minister if he could bring
about the interview. Hun Woe, with many genuflections,
informed me that the delight of serving me
would more than recompense him for any trouble he
was likely to incur, ending his protestations of deep
friendship and regard by inquiring how much of the
needful the gentleman in Chemulpo would be prepared
to place on the table. I replied by naming a sum about
one quarter of the amount I was willing to pay. The
Prime Minister’s eyes glittered, and he made various
shrugs of the shoulders and motions with his hands,
during the time that he politely intimated to me his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
rise in the world since last I met him. A cash dividend
which would have been ample in those days, he
gently hinted, was little less than an insult at the present
time. So far as he was himself concerned, he
added, his services were freely at my disposal, and
none of the silver would stick to <em>his</em> fingers; but, as I
must be aware, the Court at Seoul was a most grasping
and avaricious body, and he should need to disburse
freely before my object could be accomplished.</p>

<p>I sighed and shook my head, rising to leave, regretting
it was not to be my good fortune to add to the
wealth of an old friend, whereupon Hun Woe begged
me to be seated again, and, after many declarations of
affectionate esteem, was good enough to name a sum
which he thought might be sufficient to cover all expenses;
and as this came to less than half of what I
was willing to dispose of, we speedily reached an
agreement. This haggling at the outset was necessary,
not only to save Hemster his hardly earned
money, but also to satisfy the official that he was driving
a shrewd bargain. I accordingly paid the sum in
prompt cash to Hun Woe, and then informed him that
if everything went off to the satisfaction of my employer
a further bonus would be awarded him, depending
in size on the celerity and satisfactory nature of the
interview. This delighted the honest Premier, and I
must admit that he conducted the business with an
energy and despatch which was as gratifying as it was
unexpected.</p>

<p>East or West, money is a great lubricator, and, as I
have said, I was well provided. That very afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Hun Woe secured me an audience with His Imperial
Majesty, and for the third or fourth time in my life I
stood before the ruler of Corea. I do not know
whether he recognized me or not, but it was quite evident
that the scent of gold was in the air, and the Emperor
did not leave it long in doubt that he intended to
acquire as much as might be available of it. By way
of introduction, and to show that I was prepared to do
the proper thing, I placed a heavy bag of the seductive
metal on the shabby deal table before him, begging His
Majesty to accept it as an earnest of more to follow.
He poured it out on the table, and gloated over it with
a miser’s eagerness. He had not improved in appearance
since last we met. The seams of dissipation had
cut deeply into the royal countenance, and his little
crinkling pig eyes were even more rapacious and cruel
than I remembered them to be.</p>

<p>The proposal to come aboard the yacht was at once
dismissed as impracticable. His Majesty would not
venture away from his capital, and, above all, he would
not risk his precious person on board of anybody’s
steamship, so, on the whole, it was just as well that Mr.
Hemster had not essayed the navigation of the river
Han. However, His Majesty was good enough to inform
me that although he would not trust his royal
person to the care of the infidels, yet he would make
up for that by giving so generous a suitor a suite of
rooms in the Palace itself, and my principal would
therefore have the honour of being the guest of Corea,
as one might say. I imagined that this would look as
well in the columns of the “New York Herald” as if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the Emperor had gone on board the yacht. I fancied
that a few lines, something to the following effect,
would read very acceptably in the Sunday papers of
Chicago, under the head of <cite>Society Notes</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mr. Silas K. Hemster, of this city, and Miss Hemster,
occupy a suite of rooms in the royal Palace of Seoul, as guests
of the Emperor of Corea.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So, all in all, I was more than satisfied with the
speedy and gratifying outcome of my mission to the
Corean capital. After retiring from the royal presence
I congratulated the Prime Minister upon his method of
conducting negotiations and gave him a further payment
on account, so that he would not be tempted to
falter in well-doing; and as for Hun Woe himself he
looked upon me as the most valuable visitor that had
set foot in Corea for many years. I distributed backsheesh
somewhat indiscriminately among the underlings
of the Palace, and early next morning left the
royal precincts on my return to Chemulpo, which port
I reached without any mishap. Possibly never before
in the history of Seoul had business been so rapidly
transacted.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Hemster, as usual, sitting on deck in
his accustomed chair, as if he had no interest in the
negotiations I had been conducting. He listened quietly
to my account of the various interviews, and received
without comment the bribery bill I presented to
him. He did not appear to be so tremendously impressed
as I had expected with the royal invitation to
visit the Palace, and said he would have preferred to
take up his quarters at the chief hotel in the place, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
when I told him there was not a hotel in the city fit for
a white man to sleep in, he made no demur to the Imperial
proposal. It seemed he had visited Chemulpo
during my absence, and in consequence of what he
heard there he now made some inquiry regarding the
safety of a stay in the capital. I told him that as a
rule the Coreans were a peaceable people unless incited
to violence by the authorities, and as long as we were
willing to bribe the authorities sufficiently they would
take care that the influx of the newly acquired affluence
would not be interfered with. So he asked me to go to
Chemulpo and make arrangements for the transport of
the party next morning.</p>

<p>I had not seen Miss Hemster on the day I left for
Seoul, but she welcomed my return with her former
girlish enthusiasm, just as if nothing particular
had happened. She seemed to have entirely recovered
from her disappointment in not getting to see the Emperor
of Japan, and was now effusively enthusiastic
over our coming journey. The young woman more
than made up for her father’s lack of interest in the
royal invitation, and I was asked question after question
regarding the Palace at Seoul, which I feared
would disappoint her when she saw it, because of its
dilapidations and general lack of impressiveness.
However, a palace was a palace, she averred, and she
further pronounced the opinion that the news of their
residence there would make Chicago “sit up” when it
was cabled over. Miss Stretton sat silent with downcast
eyes during this cross-examination, her intelligent
face as inscrutable as that of the old millionaire himself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
I did not get a word with her that evening, and,
as it was drawing late, I had to return to Chemulpo to
make arrangements for the trip the following day, and
so stayed ashore that night.</p>

<p>We had a beautiful day for our expedition, and
rather a jolly trip of it,&mdash;almost, as Miss Hemster
said, as if it were a picnic. At Miss Hemster’s request
I rode by her side, with Miss Stretton sometimes with
us, but more often in front, with the old gentleman,
who jogged moodily on, absorbed in his own meditations,
saying nothing to anybody. Miss Hemster
chatted very gaily most of the day, but as evening drew
on she became tired of talk and began to look anxiously
for the gate of Seoul. When at last we passed through
it she expressed great contempt for the city of shanties,
as she called it, giving somewhat petulant expression to
her disgust at the disillusionment for which I had unsuccessfully
endeavoured to prepare her. Of course
by the time we reached the Palace the ladies were tired
out, and, if we had had the slightest notion of what
was before us, anxiety would have been added to
fatigue.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> were more comfortable in the royal
apartments than might have been expected.
Mr. Hemster had brought his own
cook with him, together with the Japanese boy to wait
on us, and he had also taken the precaution to bring a
week’s provisions, so that in spite of the primitive arrangements
of the kitchen placed at our disposal we
fared very much as usual so far as the cuisine was concerned.
The officials made no complaint at this reflection
on their hospitality; in fact, they rather relished
our foresight, because, as Hun Woe admitted with
great simplicity, it enabled them to charge our keep to
the royal exchequer and yet incur no expense in providing
for us. A system which admits of collection
and no disbursements is heavenly to a Corean official.
We were probably at the outset the most popular party
that had ever lodged in the royal Palace.</p>

<p>Our first dilemma arose, not through any interference
from the officers of the Court, but because of certain
objections which Miss Gertrude Hemster herself
promulgated. The Prime Minister did us great honour
in offering to coach us personally regarding the
etiquette that surrounds the approach to the throne. It
seemed that both Emperor and Empress were to receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
us in state, and the moment we came in sight of
their Majesties we were to turn our faces aside, as if
dazzled by the magnificence before us and the glory
conferred upon us march a dozen steps to the left, turn
again, march a dozen steps to the right, bowing extremely
low at each evolution, advancing, with great
caution and humility, never more than two steps forward
at a time, approaching the throne by a series of
crab-like movements and coming very gradually forward,
zigzag fashion, until we stood with heads humbly
inclined before the two potentates. My translation
of all this caused great hilarity on the part of Miss
Hemster, and she quite shocked the genial Prime Minister
by giving way to peal after peal of laughter. After
all, he was a dignified man and did not regard the
ceremony as a joke, which appeared to be the way it
presented itself to the young lady.</p>

<p>“I’m not going through any of that nonsense,” she
exclaimed. “Does he think I intend to make a Wild
West show of myself? If he does, he’s mistaken. I’ll
proceed right up to the Emperor and shake hands with
him, and if he doesn’t like it he can lump it. You
translate that to him, Mr. Tremorne.”</p>

<p>I intimated respectfully to the young woman that
Court etiquette was Court etiquette, and that everything
would be much more simple if we fell in with the
ways of the country. This marching and counter-marching
was no more absurd than our own way of
shaking hands, or the Pacific Island method of salutation
by rubbing noses.</p>

<p>“‘When in Rome do as the Romans do,’” I suggested;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
but this expostulation had no effect whatever
upon the determined young person, who became more
and more set in her own way from the fact that her
father quietly agreed with me. Furthermore, when she
learned that there were no chairs in the Royal reception-room,
she proclaimed that her Japanese attendant
must carry a chair for her; because, if the Royal pair
were seated, she insisted on being seated also. I was
to tell “His Nibs,”&mdash;by which expression she referred
to the smiling Prime Minister,&mdash;that she belonged to
sovereign America, and therefore was as much an Empress
in her own right as the feminine Majesty of
Corea.</p>

<p>“Miss Hemster,” said I, “I don’t know whether
what you wish can be accomplished or not; but in any
case it is sure to cause considerable delay, and, furthermore,
it will probably cost your father a very large
sum of money.”</p>

<p>I speedily saw that I would better have preserved silence.
The young lady drew herself up with great
dignity and flashed upon me a glance of withering indignation.</p>

<p>“Will you oblige me by minding your own business?”
she asked harshly. “Your duty is to obey orders,
and not to question them.”</p>

<p>To this, of course, no reply was possible, so I contented
myself by bowing to her, and, turning to Hun
Woe, who stood smiling first at one and then at the
other of us, not understanding even the drift of our
conversation, but evidently growing somewhat uneasy
at the tone it was taking, I translated to him as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
I could what Miss Hemster had said, softening the
terms as much as possible, and laying great stress on
her exalted position in her own country, of which land
the Prime Minister was enormously ignorant.</p>

<p>Hun Woe became extremely grave; and his smile,
unlike that in the advertisement, at once “came off.”</p>

<p>“If the strenuous Empress of China,” said I, “arrived
at Seoul on a visit, she would certainly be received
by His Majesty as an equal, and would not need
to go through the ceremony of advance which you have
so graphically described. Now this Princess,” I continued,
“holds herself to be of a rank superior to the
Empress of China, and is considered of higher status
by her own countrymen.”</p>

<p>The Prime Minister very solemnly shook his head
and seemed much disquieted.</p>

<p>“Her father,” I continued earnestly, and in a measure
truthfully, “maintains a much larger fleet than
China possesses, and his private war-ship, now in the
waters of Corea, is grander than anything that empire
ever beheld, much less owned. His territories are vast.
Thousands of people,&mdash;yes, millions,&mdash;pay tribute to
him. He has waged commercial war against those
who dared to dispute his authority, and has invariably
defeated them. His revenue exceeds that of the kingdom
of Corea twice over, so is it likely,&mdash;I put it to
you as man to man,&mdash;that such a potentate will consent
to the dozen steps this way, and the dozen steps
that? His only daughter is the Crown Princess, and
will be heiress to all his powers and emoluments. I
pray you, therefore, put this matter in its right light before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
His Majesty of Corea, and I can assure you, if you
succeed, your own income will be largely augmented.”</p>

<p>This speech undoubtedly impressed the Premier,
who bowed low to Mr. Hemster and his daughter time
and again as I went on. The girl’s anger had subsided
as quickly as it had risen, and she watched us both intently,
seeming at first to doubt that I translated accurately
what I had been so curtly ordered to say; but
as our conversation went on the increasing deference
of the Prime Minister showed that I was at least doing
my best. The old gentleman, too, regarded us
shrewdly from under his bushy eyebrows, but seemed
rather tired of the game, as if it were not worth such
a pow-wow. He evidently wished to get the whole
thing over as quickly as possible, and return to the
comforts of his yacht, and in this I entirely sympathized
with him.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister replied that he would present
the new facts before His Majesty, and averred that if
they had the same effect upon the Emperor of Corea
as they had produced upon the Prime Minister the impediment
would be speedily removed. He assured me
I could count on his utmost endeavours to find a solution
for the unexpected exigency, and I was well
aware that my tale would not decrease in the retelling.
With many and most profound obeisances to the two
Western grandees, the Prime Minister took his departure,
and I accompanied him outside, where I made
him a payment on a gold basis.</p>

<p>The Royal audience had been appointed for two
o’clock of the afternoon on the day succeeding our arrival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
at Seoul, but this new question that had arisen
caused the ceremony to be postponed, much to my annoyance,
for I knew the habitual delay of these people,
especially where money was in question, and I feared
that the inconvenient assumption of dignity on the part
of the young woman might land us in trouble of which
neither she nor her father had the least appreciation.
I communicated my fears of delay and complications to
the old gentleman when I got him alone, hoping he
might use his influence with his daughter to modify
what seemed to me her ill-timed assertion of high rank;
but Mr. Hemster, though a resourceful man in every
other direction, always proved a broken reed so far as
his daughter was concerned, and he pathetically admitted
his inability to curb either her actions or her
words.</p>

<p>“All we can do, Mr. Tremorne,” he said, “is to
fork over the cash. Don’t you spare it. I can see
very well you are handling this situation as expertly as
a ward politician. You’re all right. If you can talk
to this here King as you talked to his Prime Minister,
I think you’ll fix up the thing in five minutes, and remember
this is a game of bluff in which there is no
limit. I don’t restrict you in the cash you spend, so
go ahead.”</p>

<p>And this indeed proved to be the way out of the
muddle, although I explained to him that too lavish
distribution of cash was not without its own danger.
But at this juncture a message arrived to the effect
that the Prime Minister wished to see me, and I at once
departed to learn what had been the outcome of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
mediation. I found that he had made little progress,
but by a curious coincidence he put forth the same suggestion
previously offered by Mr. Hemster. He had
arranged a conference for me with the King, and advised
me, as Mr. Hemster had done, to lay it on thick.
Hun Woe was somewhat encouraged by the orders he
had received from his royal master in regard to my
audience. The King would receive me entirely alone;
not even his Prime Minister was to be present. From
this condition Hun Woe surmised I was to be successful
in my quest, and I was well aware that this unwitnessed
reception of me was as much contrary to Corean
customs as was the proposal Miss Hemster had made.</p>

<p>I saw his Majesty in one of the private apartments
of the Palace, and speedily realized that he did not care
a rap what honours belonged to Mr. Hemster. The
sinister, shifty eyes of his Majesty were filled with
greed. Never was there such a picture of avarice presented
to me as the countenance of the King showed.
His claw-like hands had been withdrawn from the
voluminous bell sleeves of his robe of red silk and yellow
gold, and were twitching nervously on the table
before him. His tremulous attitude of uneasy eagerness
reminded me of the Miser in the “Chimes of Normandy.”
Impatiently he waved aside the recital touching
the claims of my employer to the most-favoured-monarch
treatment, and gasped out the Corean equivalent
for “How much, how much?”</p>

<p>A tangible object-lesson is better than talk even in
the Orient; so, bringing my eloquence to an abrupt
conclusion, I drew from my pocket another bag of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
gold, similar in weight to the one I had previously
presented to him, and, seeing he was impatient for
touch as well as for sight, undid the string and poured
the stream of shining metal discs before him on the
table. He thrust his vibrant hands among the coins,
and gave utterance to a low guttural sound of satisfaction
which resembled the noise made by a pig thrusting
its snout into a trough of slops, rather than any exclamation
I had ever before heard from human lips. I
assured him that no word of all this would be spoken
by me, and promised that as soon as the conference
was safely over on the terms that Miss Hemster and
her father had laid down, a similar amount would be
privately paid to his Royal self in an equally secret
manner; and so my mission terminated in a glorious
success, and it was arranged that the reception should
take place the next day at two o’clock. The process
was costly, but effective; and effectiveness, after all,
was the main thing.</p>

<p>I reported my victory to Mr. Hemster and his daughter,
and almost immediately after this the Prime Minister
came in to offer his congratulations. The good
man had seen his royal master for a few moments, and
was evidently delighted that everything was going on
so smoothly. It meant money in his pocket, and he
was becoming rich with a celerity which left stock-exchange
speculations far in the rear. He had received
his commands regarding next day’s reception,
and the Emperor had been pleased to order that the
audience should take place in the same room where I
had seen him, with none of the nobles of the Court<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
present except the Prime Minister. This was a good
example of his Majesty’s craftiness. The Premier
already knew that the etiquette of the Court was to
be put aside for the occasion; but the monarch
had no desire for further witnesses, and was evidently
not going to set a precedent in the realm of
Corea that might produce inconvenient consequences
thereafter.</p>

<p>I had had little opportunity of talking with Miss
Stretton since the night of our walk on deck,&mdash;the
night of the proposal, as I called it to myself, as amidst
all these negotiations I kept continually thinking of it.
Without exactly avoiding me, Miss Stretton never
seemed to be alone, and although very rarely I caught
a glance of her eye I had no opportunity of private
speech with her. She kept very much in the background
and was more than usually quiet and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>We had dinner early that night, somewhere about
six o’clock, for there were neither candles nor lamps in
the Palace, and if we waited until nightfall we had to
“grope,” as Mr. Hemster termed it. In spite of the
success of her plans, Miss Hemster was distinctly
snappy at dinner, if I may use such a term regarding a
person so beautiful. She shut me up most effectually
when I ventured a little harmless general conversation,
and I think she made Miss Stretton feel more than
usual the bitterness of a dependent’s bread. Mr. Hemster
said nothing. I could see the poor old gentleman
was hankering for a daily paper, and from my soul I
felt sorry for him as he listened with the utmost patience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
to the querulous fault-findings of his lovely
daughter.</p>

<p>Toward the end of dinner something that was said
did not please the young lady, and she rose abruptly
and left the table, with a gesture of queenly disapproval
of us all. Anger appeared to fill her as electricity
fills an accumulator, and until the battery was
discharged we never knew who would suffer the next
shock. When the young woman’s ill-temper had been
aroused by my opposition earlier in the day, perhaps
we would have spent a pleasanter evening if it had
been allowed to run its course. But as it was checked
by her interest in the negotiations it now filtered out
in very palpable discontent. When Miss Stretton arose
to leave I took the liberty of begging her to remain.</p>

<p>“I should like very much,” I said, “to show you the
light on Nam-san.”</p>

<p>“And what is the light on Nam-san?” she asked,
pausing with her hand on the back of the chair.</p>

<p>“Beacons are lighted all along the coast of Corea,
on the mountain tops,” I replied, “so that peak calls
to peak, as it were; and the last one to be lit is that
on Nam-san, which is the name of the highest mountain
near Seoul. They kindle it at eight o’clock, and
its blazing up shows that the kingdom of Corea is
safe and at peace with the world.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Miss Stretton after a pause; “I
will return here about ten minutes to eight.”</p>

<p>She was as good as her word, and we took a stroll
together in the great courtyard of the Palace, which is
a city within a city. The gates of the Palace grounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
were now closed and guarded, and we could not have
got out into Seoul if we had wished to do so. But it
was all very still and pleasant in the broad square surrounded
by the low, strangely roofed buildings that
constituted the Palace. We saw the beacon light flash
out and then die away. I cannot remember that we
talked much, but there was a calm and soothing sense
of comradeship between us that was very comforting.
She told me, when I had tried to warn her against expecting
too much on seeing the Emperor next day,
that she did not intend to accompany our party, and I
suspected that she had been ordered to remain away.
Moreover I could see that she was very tired of it all,
and, like Mr. Hemster, wished herself back in her own
country.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Shortly</span> before two o’clock the next day the
Prime Minister came for us, and conducted us
directly to the Presence Chamber, instead of
taking us to the small wooden building, containing a
table and some chairs, where visitors usually had to
wait until the Emperor’s messenger arrived with orders
permitting an advance to the throne-room. Our
little procession consisted of four persons,&mdash;Mr. Hemster,
Miss Hemster, the Prime Minister, and myself.
Hun Woe was visibly uneasy, and I was well aware
that, in spite of the money paid him, he would much
rather have been absent from the ceremony. In Eastern
lands it is extremely dangerous for a Vizier to witness
a Sultan’s humiliation, and the Prime Minister
well knew that although the Emperor had permitted
the deference due to him to be temporarily annulled
through payment of gold, he might nevertheless consider
it desirable to eliminate the onlooker, so that no
record of this innovation were left on the earth.</p>

<p>The room into which we were conducted was but
indifferently lighted. It was oblong in shape, and a
low divan ran across the farther end of it. Four very
ordinary wooden chairs had been placed midway between
the door and the divan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>Both the Emperor and the Empress were seated,
Oriental fashion, on huge cushions, and were decked
out in a fashion that might be termed tawdry gorgeousness.
I do not know whether the strings of colored
gems that hung around the Empress were real or
imitation, but they were barbaric in size and glitter and
number. The Empress, whom I had never seen before,
sat impassive, with eyes half closed, as if she were
a statue of the feminine Buddha. During the whole
of the exciting interview she never moved or showed
the slightest sign of animation.</p>

<p>The Emperor’s ferret-like eyes glanced shiftily over
the advancing party, which came forward, as I might
say, in two sections, the three white people upright,
and the Premier bending almost double, working his
way toward the divan by zigzag courses, giving one
the odd notion that he was some sort of wild beast
about to spring upon the Emperor when he arrived at a
proper position for the pounce.</p>

<p>The twinkling eyes of the Emperor, however, speedily
deserted the rest of our party, and fixed themselves
on Miss Hemster, who moved toward him with graceful
ease and an entire absence of either fear or deference.
She instantly made good the determination she
had previously expressed, and, gliding directly up to
him, thrust forward her hand, which the Emperor
seemed at a loss what to do with. His eyes were
fastened on her lovely countenance, and there broke on
his lips a smile so grim and ghastly that it might well
have made any one shudder who witnessed it. The
bending Prime Minister uttered a few words which informed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
the Emperor that the lady wished to shake
hands with him, and then his Majesty took his own
grimy paws from out of the great bell sleeves in which
they were concealed, and with his two hands grasped
hers. Never did so sweet a hand disappear in so revolting
a clutch, and the young woman, evidently
shocked at the contact, and doubtless repelled by the
repulsiveness of the face that leered up at her, drew
suddenly back, but the clutch was not relaxed.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” she cried breathlessly, and her father
took an impulsive step forward; but before he reached
her the Emperor suddenly put forth his strength and
drew the young woman tumbling down to the divan
beside him, grimacing like a fiend from the bottomless
pit. Little he recked what he was doing. With a
scream Miss Hemster sprang up, flung out her right
arm, and caught him a slap on the side of his face that
sounded through the hall like the report of a pistol.
The Prime Minister, with a shuddering cry of horror,
flung himself on his face, and grovelled there in piteous
pretence of not having seen this death-earning insult
which the Western woman had so energetically bestowed
on the Eastern potentate. Hun Woe’s open
palms beat helplessly against the wooden planks, as if
he were in the tremors of dissolution. The active
young woman sprang back a pace or two, and, if a
glance could have killed, the look with which she transfixed
his Imperial Majesty would have brought extinction
with it.</p>

<p>As for the Emperor, he sat there, bending slightly
forward, the revolting grimace frozen on his face, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
yet his royal head must have been ringing with the
blow he had received. The Empress sat stolid, as if
nothing had happened, and never moved an eyelid.
Then his Majesty, casting a look of contempt at the
huddled heap of clothes which represented the Prime
Minister, threw back his head and gave utterance to a
cackling laugh which was exceedingly chilling and unpleasant
to hear. Meanwhile the young lady seated
herself emphatically in one of the chairs, with a sniff
of indignant remonstrance.</p>

<p>“There,” she said, “I flatter myself I have taught
one nigger a lesson in good manners. He’ll bear the
signature of my fingers on his cheeks for a few hours
at least.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” I said solemnly, “I beg you to restrain
yourself. Your signature is more likely to prove a
death-warrant than a lesson in etiquette.”</p>

<p>“Be quiet,” she cried angrily to me, turning toward
me a face red with resentment; “if there is no one
here to protect me from insult I must stand up for myself,
and you can bet your bottom dollar I’ll do it. Do
you think I am afraid of an old hobo like that?”</p>

<p>The Emperor watched her with narrowing eyes as
she was speaking, and it really seemed as if he understood
what she said; for again he threw back his head
and laughed, as if the whole thing was a joke.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I, “it isn’t a question of fear or the
lack of it, but merely a matter of common sense. We
are entirely in this man’s power.”</p>

<p>“He daren’t hurt us,” she interrupted with a snap,
“and he knows it, and you know it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Miss Hemster, I know a great
deal more of these people than you do. No Westerner
can predict what may happen in an Eastern Court.”</p>

<p>“Westerners are just as good as New Yorkers, or
Londoners either, for that matter,” cried the gentle
Gertrude, holding her head high in the air.</p>

<p>“You mistake me, Miss Hemster; I am speaking of
Europeans as well as of Americans. This Emperor,
at a word, can have our heads chopped off before we
leave the room.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re a finicky, babbling old woman,” she
exclaimed, tossing her head, “and just trying to
frighten my father. The Emperor knows very well
that if he laid a hand on us the United States would
smash his old kingdom in two weeks.”</p>

<p>“If you will pardon me, madam, the Emperor is
quite ignorant. If he should determine to have us
executed, not all the United States or Britain and Europe
combined could save us. He has but to give an
order, and it will be rigidly obeyed if the heavens
fell the moment after. If you are anxious to give the
Emperor your opinion of him, all I beg of you is that
you wait until we’re out of this trap, and then send it
to him on a picture post-card. Whatever action the
Powers might subsequently take would be of no assistance
to us&mdash;when we are executed.”</p>

<p>During this heated conversation the Prime Minister
had partly risen to his hands and knees, although he
kept his head hanging down until it nearly touched the
floor. The Emperor had been watching Miss Hemster’s
animated countenance, and he seemed greatly to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
enjoy my evident discomfiture. Even though he understood
no word of our language, he saw plainly
enough that I was getting the worst of the verbal encounter.
Now the gradual uprising of the Prime Minister
drew his attention temporarily to this grovelling
individual, and he spoke a few words to him which at
once raised my alarm for the safety of those in my
care. His Majesty had evidently forgotten for the moment
that I understood the Corean tongue. Hun Woe
now rose to his feet, kept his back at an angle of
forty-five degrees, and, without turning around, began
to retreat from the Imperial presence. I at once
stepped in his way, and said to the Emperor that this
command must not go forth, whereupon the Majesty
of Corea was good enough to laugh once more.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” demanded Miss
Hemster. “You must translate everything that is
said; and, furthermore, you must tell him that he has
to apologize to me for his insult at the beginning.”</p>

<p>“All in good time, Miss Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Not all in good time,” she cried, rising from her
chair. “If you don’t do that at once, I’ll go and slap
his face again.”</p>

<p>“Please believe me, Miss Hemster, that you have
already done that once too often. I assure you that
the situation is serious, and you are increasing the danger
by your untimely interference.”</p>

<p>Before she could reply, a roar of laughter from the
Emperor, who wagged his head from side to side and
rocked his body to and fro in his glee, drew my attention
to the fact that I had been outwitted. The Prime<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Minister, taking advantage of my discussion with Miss
Hemster, had scuttled silently away and had disappeared.
I fear I made use of an exclamation to which
I should not have given utterance in the presence of a
lady; but that lady’s curiosity, overcoming whatever
resentment she may have felt, clamoured to know
what had happened.</p>

<p>“His Majesty,” said I, “gave orders to the Prime
Minister doubly to guard the Palace gates, and see that
no communication reached the outside from us. It
means that we are prisoners!”</p>

<p>All this time I had not the least assistance from the
old gentleman, who sat in a most dejected attitude on
one of the wooden chairs. I had remained standing
since we entered the room. Now he looked up with
dismay on his countenance, and I was well enough acquainted
with him to know that his fear was not for
himself but for his daughter.</p>

<p>“Will you tell the Emperor,” he said, “that we are
armed, and that we demand leave to quit this place as
freely as we entered it?”</p>

<p>“I think, Mr. Hemster,” said I, “that we had better
conceal the fact that we have arms,&mdash;at least until the
Prime Minister returns. We can keep that as our
trump card.”</p>

<p>“Will you please do exactly what my father tells
you to,” snapped the young woman sharply.</p>

<p>“Hush, Gertrude!” said Mr. Hemster. Then, addressing
himself to me: “Sir,” he added, “do whatever
you think is best.”</p>

<p>I now turned to the Emperor, and made the speech<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
of my life. I began by stating that Corea had been
face to face with many a crisis during its history, but
never had she been confronted with such a situation as
now presented itself. Mr. Hemster, besides being
King, in his own right, of the provision market in Chicago,
was one of the most valued citizens of the United
States, and that formidable country would spend its last
sen and send its last man to avenge any injury done
to Mr. Hemster, or the Princess, his daughter. I asserted
that the United States was infinitely more powerful
than Russia, China, and Japan added together,
with each of whom he had hitherto chiefly dealt. This
alone would be bad enough, but the danger of the situation
was augmented by my own presence. His Majesty
might perhaps be good enough to remember that
the last time I had had the pleasure of meeting him I
was an Envoy of a country which had probably fought
more successful battles than any other nation in existence.
Great Britain was also in the habit of avenging
the injuries inflicted on her subjects; and so, if the
Emperor was so ill-fated as to incur the displeasure
of these mighty empires, whose united strength was
sufficient to overawe all the rest of the earth, he would
thus bring about the extinction of himself and of his
nation.</p>

<p>I regret to say that this eloquence was largely thrown
away. His Majesty paid but scanty attention to my
international exposition. His fishy eyes were fixed
continually on Miss Hemster, who now and then made
grimaces at him as if she were a little schoolgirl, once
going so far as to thrust out her tongue, which action<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
seemed to strike the Emperor as exceedingly comic, for
he laughed uproariously at it.</p>

<p>When I had ceased speaking the Emperor replied
in a few words, but without ever taking his eyes from
the girl. I answered him,&mdash;or, rather, was answering
him,&mdash;when Miss Hemster interrupted impatiently:</p>

<p>“What are you saying? You must translate as you
go on. I wish you would remember your position,
Mr. Tremorne, which is that of translator. I refuse
to be kept in the dark in this way.”</p>

<p>“Gertie, Gertie!” remonstrated her father. “Please
do not interfere. Mr. Tremorne will tell us what is
happening all in good time.”</p>

<p>And now the Emperor himself, as if he understood
what was being said, commanded me to translate to
them the terms he had laid down.</p>

<p>“I shall try to remember my position, Miss Hemster,”
I replied; “and, as his Majesty’s ideas coincide
with your own, I have pleasure in giving you a synopsis
of what has passed.”</p>

<p>Then I related my opening speech to the Emperor,
which appeared to commend itself to Mr. Hemster,
who nodded several times in support of my dissertation
on the national crisis.</p>

<p>“The Emperor,” I continued, “has made no comment
upon what I have laid before him. He tells us
we are free to go,&mdash;that is, your father and myself,&mdash;as
long as we leave you here. Not to put too fine a
point to it, he offers to buy you, and says he will make
you the White Star of his harem, which he seems to
think is rather a poetical expression.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, of all the gall!” exclaimed Miss Hemster,
raising her hands and letting them fall helplessly into
her lap again, as if this gesture should define the situation
better than any words she had at her command.
“You inform His Nibs that I am no White Star Line,
and you tell this mahogany graven image that my
father can buy him and his one-horse kingdom and
give them away without ever feeling it. When he
talks of buying, just inform him that in the States down
South we used to sell better niggers than him every day
in the week.”</p>

<p>I thought it better to tone down this message somewhat,
and in doing so was the innocent cause, as I suspect,
of a disaster which has always troubled my mind
since that eventful time. I said to the Emperor that
American customs differed from those of Corea. Miss
Hemster, being a Princess in her own rank, of vast
wealth, could not accept any position short of that of
Empress, and, as there was already an Empress of
Corea, the union he proposed was impossible. I reiterated
my request that we be allowed to pass down
to the coast without further molestation.</p>

<p>This statement was received by the Emperor with
much hilarity. He looked upon it merely as an effort
on my part to enhance the price of the girl, and expressed
his willingness to turn over to her half the
revenues of the kingdom. He seemed to imagine he
was acting in the most lavishly generous manner, and I
realized the hopelessness of the discussion, because I
was face to face with a man who had never been refused
anything he wished for since he came to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
throne. His conceited ignorance regarding the power
of other countries to enforce their demands made the
situation all the more desperate.</p>

<p>At this juncture the crouching Prime Minister returned,
made his way slowly, by means of acute angles,
to the foot of the throne, and informed the Emperor
that the guards of the Palace had been doubled, and
had received instructions to allow no living thing to
enter or leave the precincts of the Court. I now repeated
to Hun Woe the warning I had so fruitlessly
proffered to the Emperor, but I doubt if the satellite
paid much more attention than his master had done.
While in the presence he seemed incapable of either
thought or action that did not relate to his Imperial
chief. He intimated that the audience was now finished
and done with, and added that he would have the
pleasure of accompanying us to our rooms. It seemed
strange, when we returned, to find Miss Stretton sitting
in a chair, placidly reading a book which she had
brought with her from the yacht, and the Japanese boy
setting out cups for tea on a small table near her.
Miss Stretton looked up pleasantly as we entered, closing
her book, and putting her finger in it to mark the
place.</p>

<p>“What a long time you have been,” she said; “the
conference must have proved very successful.”</p>

<p>Miss Gertrude Hemster paced up and down the
room as if energetic action were necessary to
calm the perturbation of her spirit. As the
other finished her remark she clenched her little fist
and cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll make that Emperor sit up before I’ve done
with him!”</p>

<p>I thought it more advisable to refrain from threats
until we were out of the tiger’s den; but the reticent
example of Mr. Hemster was upon me, and I said
nothing. Nevertheless the young woman was as good
as her word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Hemsters had fallen into the English
habit of afternoon tea, and, having finished
the refreshing cup, I excused myself and
went outside to learn how strict the cordon around us
was kept. I found that the Prime Minister had done
his work well. The gates were very thoroughly
guarded, and short of force there seemed to be no
method of penetrating into the city. I tried bribery,
desiring to get a short note through to the British
Consul-General, and, although my bribe was willingly
accepted, I found later that the missive was never sent.</p>

<p>Rambling around the vast precincts of the Palace,
trying to discover any loophole of escape, I came upon
our escort and the ponies which had brought us from
the port to the capital. These had been gathered up in
the city and taken inside. I could not decide at the moment
whether this move on the part of our gaolers
strengthened or weakened our position. The escort
was composed of a very poor set of creatures who
would prove utterly valueless if the crisis developed
into a contest. They were all huddled together under
a shed, and were very evidently in a state of hopeless
panic. They knew intuitively that things were going
badly with us, and it needed no prophet to foretell that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
they would instantly betray us if they got the chance,
or cut our throats if they were ordered to do so. I
deeply regretted now that we had not stayed longer at
Chemulpo until we had gathered together an escort
composed entirely of Japanese. Two Japanese followers
were among our crowd, and they now stood
apart with the imperturbable nonchalance of their race.
I was aware that I could depend upon them to the
death; but the rest were the very scum of the East,
cowardly, unstable as water, and as treacherous as
quicksand. I spoke a few words of encouragement to
the Japanese, patted the ponies, and then returned to
Mr. Hemster. I told him I had endeavoured to send a
note to the British representative in Seoul, and to my
amazement found that he did not approve of this move.</p>

<p>“The fact is, Mr. Tremorne, we have acted like a
parcel of fools, and if this thing ever gets out we shall
be the laughing-stock of the world. I don’t want
either the American or the British Consul to know anything
of our position. God helps those who help themselves.
I don’t want to boast at all, but I may tell you
I’m a dead shot with a revolver, and I have one of the
best here with me, together with plenty of cartridges.
This expertness with a gun is a relic of my old cowboy
days on the plains, and if these here Coreans attempt
to interfere with me, somebody is going to get hurt.
You have another revolver, and if you are any good
with it I guess we’ll have no difficulty in forcing our
way through this flock of sheep. Have you learned
whether your two Japanese can shoot or not? If they
can, I’ve got revolvers here for them, and it seems to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
me that four of us can put up a bluff that will carry us
through this tight place. If it wasn’t that we have
women with us, I wouldn’t mind the encounter in the
least. As it is, we’ll have to do the best we can, and I
propose that we start to-morrow as soon as the gates
are opened.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Hemster, I believe your diagnosis
of the case is correct. I can trust the Japanese, and I
think I may say you can trust me.”</p>

<p>A little later in the day, the Prime Minister, accompanied
by an imposing following, came to me, and with
much circumlocution made formal proposal of marriage
to Miss Hemster on behalf of the Emperor of
Corea. The misguided man appeared to think that
this smoothed away all difficulty, and that the only
question now to be settled was the amount of money
the honoured lady’s father would pay down as dowry.
Hun Woe fatuously ventured to hope that it would be
large in proportion to the elevation in station which
awaited the young lady. I replied that Mr. Hemster
considered himself equal in rank, and greatly superior
in wealth and power, to the Emperor of Corea; that
he was now practically held prisoner in the Palace;
therefore, if negotiations were to continue, he must be
set free, and allowed to return to his own battleship,
in which I should be happy to carry on the discussion
in a manner which I hoped would prove satisfactory
to all parties concerned.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister replied that what I proposed
was impossible. The Emperor was completely infatuated
with Miss Hemster, and only as a great concession,&mdash;due,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Hun Woe said, to his own pleadings, which
he hoped would be remembered when settlements were
made,&mdash;did his Majesty consent to a marriage. The
Prime Minister continued with many professions of
friendship for myself, urging me therefore, as he pretended
to have urged the Emperor, to put myself in a
reasonable frame of mind. He had never known the
Emperor so determined in any course of action before,
and lack of compliance on the part of our company
would do no good, and might lead to irretrievable disaster.
The Emperor had resolved, if his offer were refused,
to seize the young lady, and to behead her father,
myself, and the whole party who accompanied her. He
therefore trusted humbly that I would not thwart his
efforts toward an amicable understanding.</p>

<p>I said he must surely have mistaken his instructions;
the barbarous programme he had proposed would shock
the civilized world. He answered, with a shrug of his
shoulders, that the civilized world would never hear
of it. I averred he was mistaken in this, telling him
I had already communicated with my Consul, and his
reply to this was to pull from his sleeve the hasty note
I had written and bribed the man at the gate to deliver.
This man, he said, had at once brought the communication
to him, and he hoped I would acknowledge the
fruitlessness of further opposition.</p>

<p>I quickly saw that we were in a predicament, and
that it would need all my diplomacy to find a means of
egress. However, I determined first to impress upon
Hun Woe the dangers of the plan he had outlined.
If the Emperor did what he proposed to do, that would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
bring upon Corea the irretrievable disaster of invasion
by both the United States and England. It was not
possible to keep assassinations secret. Mr. Hemster’s
great steamship was at this moment awaiting him at
Chemulpo. If no one returned, the captain of that
boat had orders to communicate at once with both the
British and the American authorities. I endeavored
to flatter Hun Woe by telling him that an official of his
great learning and intelligence must realize what the
result would be. The good man sighed, but in the
presence of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entourage</i> apparently had not the courage
to admit that Corea would come badly out of the
encounter. In fact, he said that the Emperor could
defend his country against the combined forces of the
world; but whether he believed this or not, I should
hesitate to say.</p>

<p>I now changed my tactics, and told the Prime Minister
that I was merely Ambassador for Mr. Hemster,
and that I would inform him of the offer the Emperor
had made. It was more than likely, I asserted, that
the proposal would be extremely gratifying to him; so
we would postpone further consideration until he had
time to think over the matter. I further suggested
that we should have another interview with the Emperor
at the same hour next day, and with this the
Prime Minister joyously concurred. To assist the negotiations
he told me that the Emperor had referred
to my objection of an existing Empress, but means
would be found to divorce that august lady, and this he
wished me to place before Mr. Hemster and his daughter.
He seemed to imagine that thus had been removed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
the last obstacle to the proposed union, and I
said I would put all this in the most favourable light
before Mr. Hemster. The conference which had begun
so tempestuously therefore ended in a calm that
was extremely gratifying to the Prime Minister, who
quite evidently hoped that everybody would be reasonable,
that the flow of gold should not cease, and that
the contest might end happily. So, with many gestures
and expressions of deep regard for myself and
my companions, the distinguished party withdrew.</p>

<p>I was anxious to see Mr. Hemster alone, so that I
might communicate to him the result of my interview
with the Prime Minister, but this intention was frustrated.
Gertrude Hemster had nothing whatever to
occupy her mind, and the adage informs us that mischief
is provided for all such persons. She was already
aware that this gorgeous deputation had waited
upon me, and it required all her father’s persuasion to
keep her from breaking in upon us and learning what
was going on. The curiosity of woman has before
now wrecked many promising undertakings, and this
threatened to be the fate of Mr. Hemster’s plan. The
young lady was frank enough to say that she believed
me to be playing a double game; not interpreting correctly
the message of the Emperor or the sayings of the
Prime Minister. She refused to incur the risk of a
forced exit from the Palace, and was sure that if the
Emperor was rightly spoken to we would all be allowed
to march to the port with a royal escort and
the honours of war. She insisted that if I were not a
coward I would myself brave the dangers of the exit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
go to the American Consulate, and there get an interpreter
who would be official, and also bring the Consul
himself. She was not going to be frightened out of
Seoul by a mud-colored heathen like the Emperor, and
if only we had treated him as she had done, there
would have been no trouble.</p>

<p>I must admit that I agreed with the girl so far as
calling in the aid of the American Consul was concerned,
and I told her I was quite willing to force the
gate and make a run for it to the little spot of the
United States which existed in Seoul. But her father
could be a determined man when he liked, and this time
he put down his foot, declaring firmly that he would
not have the news of this fiasco get abroad if he could
help it. Curiously enough, Mr. Hemster seemed to
have more fear of the yellow press of America
than of the yellow man of Corea. His daughter, however,
feared neither, and seemed in fact to relish the
publicity which this episode might give to her.
Whether it was bravery or recklessness on her part, I
could not get her to see that we were in any serious
danger; but this did not matter, for on appeal to her
father to postpone the proposed exodus he proved
adamant, and for once the young lady was forced to
acquiesce.</p>

<p>I took the pair of extra pistols, and, with ample ammunition,
sought out the two Japanese members of our
party. I found that both of them had served in the
Japanese army and were quite capable of handling
firearms with effect. I then told them to say nothing
to their Corean comrades, but, as soon as the gates were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
open in the morning, to bring ponies for the whole party
to our door. The manner in which they carried out
this order showed their alertness to the exigencies of
the situation.</p>

<p>When we all emerged in the morning,&mdash;we four
white people, our Chinese cook and Japanese serving-boy,&mdash;ten
ponies were at our door, two of them being
loaded down with heavy strings of cash which we had
not found occasion to use, because our dealings had
been entirely with higher classes and so we had had to
employ silver and gold. But only one Japanese man
was there. When I asked him where the other fellow
was, he replied he was holding a revolver over the
huddled heap of Coreans so that they would not give
the alarm. As soon as we were mounted, he said he
would call his comrade, who would instantly respond.</p>

<p>This proved a very wise precaution, and gave us
some valuable minutes before the Palace was roused.
We had arrived at the gates ere the sleepy guards realized
what was upon them, and the first warning the
Palace received of our attempt was the wild firing of
the useless muskets which the guards possessed. We
had determined not to shoot, hoping that the guards
would give way when they found we were resolved to
emerge; but their reckless firing, which luckily did no
harm to any of our party, made any further attempt
at silence unnecessary, and lucky it was for us that we
were free to fire, because Mr. Hemster whipped out
his revolver at once and shattered the hand of a man
who attempted to close the gates. This wounded creature
set up such a howl that the guards immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
threw down their arms and fled, leaving the way clear
before us.</p>

<p>Now we were in the main street of Seoul, and if it
had not been for Mr. Hemster’s prohibition I would
strongly have advised making directly for the Consulate
of either one nation or the other. However,
his orders were to press on to the western gate before
the alarm should extend through the city. This we
did. Now that we were clear of the royal gates, the
guards seemed to have resumed their firearms and were
evidently determined to make the Emperor believe that
they had been extremely valorous, for a regular fusillade
greeted our departure down the main street of
Seoul. Whatever commotion the firing may have
aroused in the Palace, it certainly had an extraordinary
effect upon the city itself, for it caused the population
to pour in thousands from the narrow lanes with which
this human warren is intersected. There seemed a
danger that we might be stopped by the mere pressure
of the crowd, so I gave the word to whip up our steeds,
and we dashed along, regardless of whom we knocked
over.</p>

<p>Just as we reached the gate on the Chemulpo road
the great bell began to ring, the bell which every night
at sunset orders the closing of the gates. The big
doors were being slowly closed as we approached, and
here my two Japanese again gave striking proof of
their value. They dashed forward, and, in spite of the
ringing of the bell, ordered the guards to fling wide the
portal, but upon the guards showing some hesitation,
the foremost Japanese at once shot one of them in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
tracks, whereupon the rest fled. We squeezed through,
and the Japanese proposed we should close the gates
completely, so that the crowd might be kept in, but
this proved impossible, because they could be fastened
only on the inside, and we had no means of assuring
ourselves that the gates would remain shut. There
was therefore nothing for it but a race for Chemulpo,
twenty-six miles away. Before we had gone a dozen
yards the pressure of the crowd opened the gates wide,
and the howling mob poured through like a resistless
torrent.</p>

<p>I now re-arranged my party, asking Mr. Hemster to
take the lead, while the two Japanese and myself fought
a retreating battle with the multitude that followed us.
The Corean man is a stalwart individual with sturdy
legs that are almost untiring in a race. While cowards
individually, they become dangerous in the mass, and
I continually urged our people to gallop as hard as they
could, with the double purpose of exhausting all but
the most strenuous in our pursuit, and of preventing
the outskirts of the mob on either hand from outflanking
us. For the first three miles or so our revolver-shots
kept them at a respectful distance, but
after five or six miles had been accomplished, and the
crowd showed no signs of fatigue, while our ammunition
began to run low, I realized that I must do something
to save the rest from capture.</p>

<p>Leaving the two Japanese as an efficient rearguard,
I galloped forward to Mr. Hemster, and gave him details
of my plan, which I had some difficulty in getting
him to accept. In fact he did accept it only on my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
assurance that there was no real danger to myself.
Bidding a hasty farewell to the ladies, I dropped again
to the rear. Each of the Japanese had tethered to his
horse’s bridle a rope attached to a pony carrying our
strings of cash. I untied these ponies, and attached
them to my own mount, ordering the Japanese to take
the van once more; and, as they were residents of
Chemulpo, and therefore knew the road perfectly, I
told them to lead the party as quickly as they could into
safety, promising them a large additional reward for
doing so.</p>

<p>The rest now galloped on, leaving me standing in the
middle of the road, with three horses under my charge.
The bellowing mob seemed nonplussed by this movement,
and, apparently fearing a trap of some kind,
came to a halt. There was not bravery enough among
them even to attack one man at close quarters, although
they might have overwhelmed him by simply moving
in bulk upon him. Each of the two led-horses carried
something like twenty thousand sek, strung in
ropes of five hundred each, so knotted that the cash
is divided into sections of a hundred each. I took my
pocket-knife and cut off the first knot, and, grasping
the two ends of the string, flung it lasso-wise around
my head, and then let go the cut end, causing the hundred
cash to shoot into the air like the bursting of a
sky-rocket. These people, after all, were merely like
children with two dominant qualities, a love of cruelty,
and an unlimited avarice,&mdash;possibly avarice has the
greatest hold upon their affections, and this belief was
the basis of my adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>Now ensued the strangest battle that ever was fought
by mankind, a struggle which Mr. Hemster himself
should have appreciated because he had engaged in it
time and again in his own country, a battle in which
one man with money stood against the bulk of the
people. When the shower of a hundred cash was flung
above the heads of the mob there ensued one of the
wildest struggles it has ever been my fate to witness.
I cut the second knot, and flung the second lot of cash
far to the left, to check the advance of the crowd that
way, which it very effectually did. Then the third
knot was severed, and the third lot of coins went spinning
through the air to the right. Even before the
first string was gone, my party had long since disappeared
toward the west. Of course this congregation
of heathens could have availed themselves at once of
my whole available stock by merely pressing forward,
but this thought either never occurred to them, or they
were too cowardly to put it into practice. As soon as
the flung cash was secured and the scattered stock
picked up, two and two fighting for the possession of
one miserable coin, a shout arose from them which was
the cry of Oliver Twist for “more.” And so I played
David against that Goliath of a crowd until I began
to fear that my arm which whirled the sling would become
helpless through exhaustion.</p>

<p>My idea had been, of course, to put the whip to my
horse and make for the port after my party, but very
soon this project proved to be impossible. I was standing
on a slight elevation in the road, and, in spite of my
throwing the coins right and left, the two wings of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
tatterdemalion army gradually enfolded me, and before
my fortune was more than half scattered I found myself
completely outflanked and surrounded. But no
one made a dash; there was left a respectable circular
clear space about me, the circumference of which was
never nearer than twenty or thirty feet from where I
stood. Moreover I was thankful to see that even those
to the west, who had a free way toward Chemulpo, did
not attempt to break toward the coast. They were all too
eager to get a share of the spoil to mind what became
of the rest of the party, and by the time we had been
an hour or more at this flinging of largesse every individual
of them knew that pursuit was hopeless, and by
the same token I knew also that the least danger threatening
me was being carried back to Seoul. The crowd
had become riotously good natured, but I knew their
changeableness too well to consider myself safe on that
account. They were as like as not to take me back to
Seoul in a hundred pieces. I began to think seriously
of the future when I came to the last string of cash
on the pony beside me. There was still twenty thousand
on the other nag; but, when that was gone, this mob,
which had no sense of gratitude, were as like to cut my
throat as not. So when I came to the last hundred
sek on the first pony, scattered like grape-shot through
the air, I took advantage of the struggle that ensued to
remount my own nag. There was at once a howl of
rage at this, especially from those to the west of me,
who expected me to attempt escape in that direction.
They stiffened up, and shook fists and sticks at this
supposed intention on my part to cheat them of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
just dues. Never since the Corean kingdom was
founded had there been such a distribution of wealth
as was now taking place. Heretofore the office-holders
had accumulated everything in sight, and naturally the
populace was indignant that this enchanting scattering
of money should cease while there was still a horseload
of it within reach. I raised my right hand for
silence, and then raised my voice and addressed them:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said I, “the next hurling of coin takes
place at the gates of Seoul. If you are good enough
to march quietly with me, I shall relieve the tedium of
the way by an occasional contribution. So, my braves,
let us get back to the capital.”</p>

<p>Capital was what they were after, and so with a
howl, which was their nearest approach to a cheer, we
set off for Seoul. Tired as my arm was, I occasionally
distributed five hundred cash before and behind me,
also to the right and left, keeping steadily on, however,
until the city was in sight. Then to my dismay, I saw
that the great gate was closed. The mob ahead of me
had noticed the barred gate before I did, and set up a
wail like a lot of lost children. Instantly the cash distribution
was forgotten, and panic seized them. They
were locked out, and no one knew what might be happening
inside. The tolling of the big bell still boomed
through the air, but only occasionally, bearing some
resemblance to a funeral knell. Because the gate was
shut these people had not reasoning powers enough to
surmise that the other gates were shut also, and in a
magic way the huge mob began to dissolve and disappear,
scampering over rocks and stones to find out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
whether the whole city was hermetically sealed or not.
There was a group of people on the wall above the
gate, and someone had shouted that the northern port
was open. This statement was undoubtedly false, but
the official who cried it evidently thought it was safer
to dismiss the mob as he could. In a few minutes I
found myself practically alone, and then was amazed
beyond measure to hear a voice from above the gate
call down to me:</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, Tremorne, is that you?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I looked</span> up, and saw leaning toward me Wallace
Carmichel, the British Consul-General in
Seoul, an efficient man whom I had not met for
five years, when he was in the Embassy at Pekin. At
once there flashed through my mind Mr. Hemster’s
desire that I should not mention our plight to the Consuls
of either his country or my own, so I resolved on
the instant to keep to myself, if possible, the mission
that had brought me to the capital. Indeed within the
last few minutes the whole situation had changed. I
had no desire to return to Seoul, and only retreated because
I was compelled to do so; but now the way was
perfectly clear between me and Chemulpo on turning
my horse around. Yet Carmichel would think it exceedingly
strange if I could not give some excuse for
marching up to the gate of Seoul and marching down
again, like the historical general on the hill. I wished
he had remained at his Consulate, yet there he was,
beaming down upon me, so I took momentary refuge
in airy persiflage.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Carmichel, how goes it? Has the early-closing
movement been adopted in Seoul? It isn’t
Saturday afternoon, is it?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t,” he replied, “and if you’ll take the
advice of an old friend, you’ll turn your horse’s head,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
and make straight back for Chemulpo. I think we’re
in for a rather nasty time here, if you ask me.”</p>

<p>“I do ask you. What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>I was anxious to learn whether he knew anything of
the escape of our party in the early morning; but even
if he had been told about it, the Coreans are such unmitigated
liars that it is not likely he would have believed
them if he had not himself seen the procession,
and I very much doubted if he had done so, for Carmichel
was never afflicted with the early-rising habit.
I was, however, wholly unprepared for his amazing
reply.</p>

<p>“The Empress of Corea was assassinated last
night,” he said. “I imagine they don’t want the news
to spread. The Palace is closed, and all the gates of
the city were shut before I was up this morning. The
Court entourage is trying to pretend that the Empress
died a natural death, but I have it on as good authority
as anything can be had in this mendacious place that
the Empress was literally cut to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” I cried. “Can that be true?”</p>

<p>“Anything may be true in this forsaken hole. I
heard you had left the service. Came into a fortune,
eh? Lucky devil! I wish I were in your shoes!
This is worse than China, and that was bad enough. I
suppose you are here on private business. Well, take
a friend’s advice and get back. Nothing can be done
here for a while, any how.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take your advice, Carmichel. Is there any
message I can carry for you to Chemulpo?”</p>

<p>“No, you may tell them what’s happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you in any danger, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. Of course, one can never tell
what may turn up in this beastly place. I’ve got the
Consulate well guarded, and we can stand a siege. I
heard that there was a mob approaching the town, and
so came up to see what it was all about. Where are
you stopping at Chemulpo?”</p>

<p>“I have been yachting with a friend of mine, and
his craft is in the harbour there.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ve no business in Seoul, I advise you
to get back to the yacht. You’ll be safer on the sea
than in Corea.”</p>

<p>“I believe you!”</p>

<p>“How did you come to be in the midst of that Bank
Holiday gang, Tremorne?” asked the Consul, his curiosity
evidently rising.</p>

<p>“Oh, they overtook me, so we came along together.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder they didn’t rob you of all you
possess.”</p>

<p>“I forestalled that by scattering something like
twenty thousand sek among them. I thought I’d be
all right when I came to the gate, but was rather taken
aback to find it closed.”</p>

<p>“Twenty thousand sek! And I suppose you don’t
mind throwing it away any more than a handful of
ha’ pence! Lucky beggar! And yachting around the
world with a millionaire friend, I expect. Well, life’s
easy for some people,” said the Consul-General with a
sigh.</p>

<p>I laughed at him, and wondered what he would have
said had he known the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure you don’t want me to send a guard up from
Chemulpo for you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think our consulate will be the storm-center
here. I rather imagine the tornado will rage
around the residence of our Japanese friends. The
Coreans say that a Japanese killed one of the guards
here this morning at the gate, but the Japanese Minister
insists that all of his countrymen in the city are
accounted for, and that this allegation of murder is a
lie, which I have not the least doubt it is. I heard a
lot of promiscuous firing this morning before I was up,
but it seemed to me all in the direction of the Palace.
They are eternally raising some shindy here, and blaming
it on decent people. I’m sorry to see you turn
back, Tremorne, but a man who isn’t compelled to stay
here is wise to avoid such diggings. If you return
you’ll call on me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly,” said I, gathering up the reins. “So
long, Carmichel, and be as good to yourself as you
can.”</p>

<p>Saying this I turned toward Chemulpo, and reached
it very late that night. The journey was one of the
most disagreeable I had ever taken, for my right arm&mdash;I
suppose through the straining of the muscles&mdash;became
utterly helpless and very painful. It swelled
so, especially at the shoulder, that I feared I should
have to cut the sleeve of my coat. David was more
fortunate than I, because he did his business with one
shot: my giant required continual shooting, and now I
was suffering for it. If I had been attacked, I should
have found myself completely helpless; but fortunately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the way was clear, and with my three steeds I
came through without mishap. Before going on board
I searched out my two Japanese, and found, as I expected,
that Mr. Hemster had rewarded them with a
liberality that took their breath away. He had paid
them for the three horses, which he looked upon as lost,
and now I turned the nags over to them, together with
the twenty thousand sek that was on one of them; so
the brave, resourceful little men had no complaint to
make regarding lack of recognition.</p>

<p>I had not intended to go aboard the yacht that night,
but Mr. Hemster had made the Japs promise to show a
flare if any news came of me, and in the morning he
was going to organize an expedition for my rescue.
As soon as I encountered my Japs one of them ran for
a torch and set it afire. It was at once answered by a
rocket from the yacht, and before I had finished my
conversation with him I heard the measured beat of the
oars in the water, and found that in spite of his fatigue
the kindly old man himself had come ashore for me.
He tried to shake hands, but I warded him off with
my left arm, laughing as I did so, and told him my
right would not be in condition for some time yet. As
we rowed out to the yacht I told him all that had happened,
and informed him about the murder of the Empress,
which news my Japanese friends were commissioned
to proclaim in Chemulpo, as I had promised the
British Consul. Mr. Hemster was much affected by
this news, and I saw plainly that he considered his ill-fated
expedition to have been the probable cause of
this unfortunate lady’s taking off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>I was nearly famished when we reached the steamer,
for I had had nothing since early morning but a ham
sandwich I had put in my pocket. The bag of provisions
intended for consumption on the way had been
carried by the Chinese cook, and at the moment of
parting I had thought nothing of the commissariat,
which was extremely poor generalship on my part, and
an omission which caused me sorrow later in the day.</p>

<p>Sitting in the boat after my exertions left me so stiff
and unwieldy that one of the sailors had to help me up
the side, and, stepping on deck, I staggered, and would
have fallen if he had not caught me. The waning
moon had risen, but the light was not strong. I saw a
shadowy figure make for the companion-way, then
stop with a little cry, and run forward to where I
stood.</p>

<p>“You are wounded, Mr. Tremorne!” she cried.</p>

<p>“No, Miss Stretton, I am all right, except my arm,
and its disablement is rather a joke than otherwise.”</p>

<p>“He is wounded, is he not, Mr. Hemster?” appealed
the girl, as the old man came up the gangway.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, child! You should have been in bed long
ago! He isn’t wounded, but he’s nearly starved to
death through our taking away all the provisions with
us when we deserted him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she cried. “Then you didn’t find the
bag.”</p>

<p>“What bag?” I asked.</p>

<p>“When we were having lunch Mr. Hemster remembered
that you were unprovided for, so we raised a
cairn of stones by the wayside and left a bag of provisions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
on top of it, hoping you would recognize it,
for Mr. Hemster felt sure you would win through
somehow or other. You would be extremely flattered,
Mr. Tremorne, if you knew what faith he has in you.”</p>

<p>I laughed and told her I was glad to hear it.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” said the old man. “Don’t stand idly
chattering here when there’s a first-rate supper spread
out for you down below. Away you go. I must have
a word with the captain, for we are off to Nagasaki
within ten minutes, so I shall bid you both good-night.”</p>

<p>I took it very kindly of the old gentleman to leave
us thus alone, and I have no doubt he thought of his
own younger days when he did so. I wickedly pretended
a greater weakness than I actually felt, and so
Miss Stretton kindly supported me with her arm, and
thus we went down the stairway together, where, as
the old gentleman had said, I found one of the most
delicious cold collations I had ever encountered,
flanked by a bottle of his very finest champagne. I
persuaded Miss Stretton to sit down opposite me,
which, after some demur about the lateness of the
hour, she consented to do, for I told her my right arm
was absolutely helpless, and the left almost equally
awkward.</p>

<p>“So,” I said, “you must prove yourself a ministering
angel now.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that,” she said, “is when pain and anguish
wring the brow. As I understand it, pain and anguish
wring the arm. Please tell me how it happened.”</p>

<p>Under the deft manipulation of the Japanese boy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
the champagne cork came out with a pop, and, as if it
were a signal-gun, there immediately followed the rattle
of the anchor-chain coming up, and almost before
my story was begun, we heard the steady throb-throb
of the engine, and it sent a vibration of thankfulness
through my aching frame.</p>

<p>“You do look haggard and worn,” she said; “and
I think I must insist on regarding you rather in the
light of a hero.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there was nothing heroic in flinging cheap
cash about in the reckless way I did. I was never in
any real danger.”</p>

<p>“I think we have all been in danger, more or less,
since we entered those Palace gates. Although I said
nothing I could see from your face what you were
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know of old your uncanny proclivities in
mind-reading. Now that every pulsation of the engine
is carrying us farther away from that plague-spot of
earth, there is no harm in saying that I spent some
days and nights of deep anxiety, and that, I assure you,
not on my own account.”</p>

<p>“I quite believe you,” said the young lady, raising
her eyes for a moment, and gazing down on the tablecloth
again. Then she looked brightly up once more,
and said archly:</p>

<p>“I hope it won’t make you conceited, but I walked
the deck to-night with fear tugging at my heart. I
don’t think I ever was so glad in my life as when
I saw the flare, as had been arranged, and knew you
were safe. When I heard you talking to Mr. Hemster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
in the boat, your voice floated over the water very distinctly,
and I think I breathed a little expression of
gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Hilda,” said I, leaning across the table, “it is very
kind of you to say that.”</p>

<p>Here, to my annoyance, the Japanese boy came into
the saloon, although I had told him I had no further
need for him that night. He approached us, and said
respectfully, and I am sure somewhat unwillingly:</p>

<p>“Miss Hemster’s compliments, sir, and she wishes
you would stop chattering here all night long, so that
people could get to sleep.”</p>

<p>Miss Stretton sprang to her feet, a crimson flush
coming into her face.</p>

<p>“Thank Miss Hemster for me,” said I to the Japanese,
“and inform her that we will finish our conversation
on deck.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried Hilda peremptorily; “it is terribly
late, and it is too bad of me keeping you talking
here when you should be resting. I assure you I did
not intend to remain on deck after I had learned of
your safe arrival.”</p>

<p>“I know that, Hilda. It was when you saw me stagger
that, like the kind-hearted girl you are, you came
forward. Now, do come up on deck with me, if only
for five minutes.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she repeated in a whisper.</p>

<p>Forgetting the condition of my arm, I made an effort
to encircle her. She whisked herself silently away,
but, hearing the groan that involuntarily escaped me
when the helpless arm struck the table and sent an electric<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
spasm of pain to my shoulder, she turned rapidly
toward me with pity in her face. Then, springing forward,
she raised her lips to mine for one infinitesimal
fraction of a second, and almost before the rest of that
moment of bliss was passed I found myself alone in
the empty saloon.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Late</span> as it was, I went up on deck, and it was
lucky for me I did so, for I met our bluff old
captain, who, when he learned of the disablement
of my arm, said genially that he had a Cape Cod
liniment good for man or donkey, and I was welcome
to it in either capacity. He ordered me down to my
stateroom, and followed later with the bottle. His own
gnarled hands rubbed the pungent-smelling stuff on
my arm, and he told me I’d be next to all right in the
morning, which prophecy came true.</p>

<p>I am sorry that in these voyages to and from Corea
we met absolutely no adventures, picked up no shipwrecked
crew, and met no cyclone, so I am unable to
write down any of those vivid descriptions that I have
always admired in Mr. Clark Russell.</p>

<p>Next morning was heavenly in its beauty and its
calm. Nagasaki was the last civilized address which
would receive telegrams, letters or papers for Mr.
Hemster, and the old gentleman was anxious to reach
there as soon as possible. As I have remarked before,
he was constantly yearning for a daily paper. The
captain informed me that he had engaged a “heathen
Chinee” as pilot, and so was striking direct from Chemulpo
to Nagasaki, letting the islands take care of
themselves, as he remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>I walked the deck, watching eagerly for the coming
of Hilda Stretton, but instead there arrived Gertrude
Hemster, bright, smiling, and beautiful. I was just
now regretting lack of opportunity to indulge in Clark-Russellism,
yet here was a chance for a descriptive
writer which proved quite beyond my powers. The
costume of Miss Hemster was bewildering in its
Parisian completeness. That girl must have had a
storehouse of expensive gowns aboard the yacht. I
suppose this was what a writer in a lady’s paper would
call a confection, or a creation, or something of that
sort; but so far as I am concerned you might as well
expect an elucidation of higher mathematics as an adequate
delineation of that sumptuous gown. All I can
say is that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> was perfect, and the girl
herself was radiant in her loveliness. She approached
me with a winning smile like that of an angel.</p>

<p>“I want you to know how I appreciate your bravery.
I shall never forget,&mdash;no, not if I live to be a thousand
years old,&mdash;how grand and noble you looked standing
up alone against that horde of savages. I was just telling
Poppa that the very first reporter he meets, he
must give a glowing account to him of your heroism.”</p>

<p>I have always noted that when Miss Hemster was in
extreme good humour she referred to the old gentleman
as Poppa; on other occasions she called him Father.
The project of giving away my adventures to the
newspapers did not in the least commend itself to me.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Miss Hemster,” I said, “I am extremely
pleased to see you looking so well after a
somewhat arduous day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>“It was rather a trying time, wasn’t it?” she replied
sweetly, “and if I look well it’s because of the
dress, I think. How do you like it?” and she stepped
back with a sweeping curtesy that would have done
credit to an actress, and took up an attitude that displayed
her drapery to the very best advantage.</p>

<p>“It is heavenly,” I said; “never in my life have I
seen anything to compare with it,&mdash;or with the
wearer,” I added.</p>

<p>“How sweet of you to say that!” she murmured,
looking up at me archly, with a winning, bird-like
movement. A glorified bird-of-paradise she seemed,
and there was no denying it. With a touching pathetic
note in her voice she continued,&mdash;very humbly, if one
might judge,&mdash;“You haven’t been a bit nice to me
lately. I have wondered why you were so unkind.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, Miss Hemster,” I said, “I have not intended
to be unkind, and I am very sorry if I have
appeared so. You must remember we have been
thrown into very trying circumstances, and as I was
probably better acquainted with the conditions than
any one of our party I always endeavoured to give the
best advice I could, which sometimes, alas, ran counter
to your own wishes. It seemed to me now and then
you did not quite appreciate the danger which threatened
us, and you also appeared to have a distrust of
me, which, I may tell you, was entirely unfounded.”</p>

<p>“Of course it was,” she cried contritely, “but nevertheless
I always had the utmost confidence in you, although
you see I’m so impulsive that I always say the
first thing that comes into my head, and that gives people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
a wrong idea about me. You take everything so
seriously and make no allowances. I think at heart
you’re a very hard man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are. You have numerous little rules, and
you measure everybody by them. I seem to feel that
you are mentally sizing me up, and that makes me say
horrid things.”</p>

<p>“If that is the case, I must try to improve my character.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not blaming you at all, only telling you
the way it strikes me. Perhaps I’m altogether wrong.
Very likely I am, and anyhow I don’t suppose it does
any good to talk of these things. By the way, how is
your arm this morning?”</p>

<p>“It is all right, thank you. The captain’s liniment
has been magical in its effect. It was very stupid of
me to get my arm in such a condition, and there is less
excuse because I used to be a first-rate cricket bowler;
but somehow yesterday I got so interested in the game
that I forgot about my muscles.”</p>

<p>“Is it true that the Empress has been murdered?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I had the news from the British Consul, and I
have no doubt of its accuracy.”</p>

<p>“How perfectly awful to think that only the day before
yesterday we saw her sitting there like a graven
image; indeed she scarcely seemed alive even then.
What in the world did they kill the poor woman for?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” I replied, although I had strong
suspicions regarding the cause of her fate. The next
statement by Miss Hemster astonished me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it served her right. A woman in that position
should assert herself. She sat there like a Chinese
doll that had gone to sleep. If she had made them
stand around they would have had more respect for
her. Any woman owes it to her sex to make the world
respect her. Think of a sleepy creature like that holding
the position of Empress, and yet making less than
nothing of it.”</p>

<p>“You must remember, Miss Hemster, that the
status of woman in Corea is vastly different from her
position in the United States.”</p>

<p>“Well, and whose fault is that? It is the fault of
the women. We demand our rights in the States, and
get them. If this creature at Seoul had been of any use
in the world she would have revolutionized the status
of women,&mdash;at least within the bounds of her own
kingdom.”</p>

<p>I ventured to remark that Oriental ideas of women
were of a low order, and that, as the women themselves
were educated to accept this state of things,
nothing much should be expected of them.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” cried Miss Hemster strenuously;
“look at the Empress of China. She makes people
stand around. Then there was Catherine of Russia,
and goodness knows Russia’s far enough behind in its
ideas! But Catherine didn’t mind that; she just
walked in, and made herself feared by the whole world.
A few more women like that in the Orient would bring
these heathen people to their senses. It serves this
Corean Queen right when you think of the opportunity
she had, and the way she misused it, sitting there like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
great lump of dough strung around with jewels she
could not appreciate, like a wax figure in a ten-cent
show. I have no patience with such animals.”</p>

<p>I thought this judgment of Miss Hemster’s rather
harsh, but experience had taught me not to be rash in
expressing my opinion; so we conversed amicably
about many things until the gong rang for luncheon.
I must say that hers was a most attractive personality
when she exerted herself to please. At luncheon she
was the life of the party, making the captain laugh outrageously,
and even bringing a smile now and then to
her father’s grave face, although it seemed to me he
watched her furtively under his shaggy eyebrows now
and then as if apprehensive that this mood might not
last,&mdash;somewhat fearful, I imagine, regarding what
might follow. I could not help noticing that there was
a subtle change in the old gentleman’s attitude toward
his daughter, and I fancied that her exuberant spirits
were perhaps forced to the front, to counteract in a
measure this new attitude. I thought I detected now
and then a false note in her hilarity, but perhaps that
may have been a delusion of my imagination, such as
it is. After the captain had gone, toward the end of
the meal, her father seemed to be endeavouring silently
to attract her attention; but she rattled on in almost
breathless haste, talking flippantly to Miss Stretton and
myself alternately, and never once looking toward the
head of the table. I surmised that there was something
beneath all this with which I was not acquainted, and
that there was going on before me a silent contest of
two wills, the latent determination of the father opposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
to the unconcealed stubbornness of the daughter.
I sympathized with the old man, because I was myself
engaged in a mental endeavour to cause Hilda Stretton
to look across at me, but hitherto without success. Not
a single glance had I received during the meal. At
last the old gentleman rose, and stood hesitating, as if
he wished to make a plunge; then, finally, he interrupted
the rattle of conversation by saying:</p>

<p>“Gertrude, I wish to have a few words with you in
my office.”</p>

<p>“All right, Poppa, I’ll be there in a minute,” she replied
nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“I want you to come <em>now</em>,” he said, with more
sternness in his voice than I had ever heard there before.
For one brief moment I feared we were going
to have a scene, but Miss Gertrude merely laughed joyously
and sprang to her feet, saying, “I’ll race you to
the office then,” and disappeared down the passage aft
almost before her sentence was ended. Mr. Hemster
slowly followed her.</p>

<p>Hilda Stretton half rose, as if to leave me there
alone, then sat down again, and courageously looked
me full in the face across the table.</p>

<p>“He is too late,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Too late for what?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Too late in exerting parental authority.”</p>

<p>“Is he trying to do that?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see it?”</p>

<p>“Well, if that was his endeavour, he succeeded.”</p>

<p>“For the moment, yes. He thinks he’s going to
talk to her, but it is she who will talk to him, and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
preferred doing it this time in the privacy of the room
he calls his office. A moment more, and he would
have learned her opinion of him before witnesses. I
am very glad it did not come to that, but the trouble
is merely postponed. Poor old gentleman, I wish I
could help him! He does not understand his daughter
in the least. But let us go on deck and have coffee
there.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to propose that,” I cried, delighted,
springing to my feet. We went up the stair together
and I placed a little wicker table well forward,
with a wicker chair on each side of it, taking a position
on deck as far from the companion-way as possible, so
that we should not be surprised by any one coming up
from below. The Japanese boy served our coffee, and
when he was gone Hilda continued her subject, speaking
very seriously.</p>

<p>“He does not understand her at all, as I have said.
Since she was a baby she has had her own way in
everything, without check or hindrance from him, and
of course no one else dared to check or hinder her.
Now she is more than twenty-one years of age, and if
he imagines that discipline can be enforced at this late
hour he is very much mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Is he trying to enforce discipline?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is. He has foolishly made up his mind
that it will be for the girl’s good. That, of course, is
all he thinks of,&mdash;dear, generous-hearted man that he
is! But if he goes on there will be a tragedy, and I
want you to warn him.”</p>

<p>“I dare not interfere, Hilda.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not? Haven’t you a very great liking for
him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have. I would do almost anything in the
world for him.”</p>

<p>“Then do what I tell you.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“See him privately in his office, and tell him to leave
his daughter alone. Warn him that if he does not there
will be a tragedy.”</p>

<p>“Tell me exactly what you mean.”</p>

<p>“She will commit suicide.”</p>

<p>This statement, solemnly given, seemed to me so utterly
absurd that it relieved the tension which was
creeping into the occasion. I leaned back in my chair
and laughed until I saw a look of pained surprise come
into Hilda’s face, which instantly sobered me.</p>

<p>“Really, Hilda, you are the very best girl in the
world, yet it is you who do not understand that young
woman. She is too thoroughly selfish to commit suicide,
or to do anything else to her own injury.”</p>

<p>“Suicide,” said Hilda gravely, “is not always a matter
of calculation, but often the act of a moment
of frenzy,&mdash;at least so it will be in Gertrude Hemster’s
case if her father now attempts to draw tight the reins
of authority. He will madden her, and you have no
conception of the depth of bitterness that is in her nature.
If it occurs to her in her next extravagant tantrum
that by killing herself she will break her father’s
heart, which undoubtedly would be the case, she is
quite capable of plunging into the sea, or sending a revolver
bullet through her head. I have been convinced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
of this for some time past, but I never thought her
father would be so ill-advised as to change the drifting
line of conduct he has always held in regard to her.”</p>

<p>“My dear Hilda, you are not consistent. Do you
remember an occasion, which to tell the truth I am
loth to recall, when you said if her father treated her
as I had done her character would be much more amiable
than it now appears to be?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I said that, Mr. Tremorne. I may
have hinted that if her father had taken a more strenuous
attitude in the past, he would not have such a difficult
task before him in the present, or I may have said
that a husband might tame the shrew. The latter, I believe,
would lead to either a reformation or the divorce
court, I don’t quite know which. Or perhaps even
then there might be a tragedy; but it would be the husband
who would suffer, not herself. A man she married
might control her. It would really be an interesting
experiment, and no one can predict whether it
would turn out well or ill; but her father cannot control
her because all these years of affectionate neglect
are behind him, years in which he was absorbed in business,
leaving the forming of her character to hirelings,
thinking that because he paid them well they would do
their duty, whereas the high salary merely made them
anxious to retain their positions at any cost of flattery
and indulgence to their pupil.”</p>

<p>“Then, Hilda, why don’t you speak to him about it?
You have known him for more years than I have days,
and I am sure he would take it kindlier from you than
from me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, I have spoken to him. I
spoke to him last night when we were both waiting for
that flare from the shore at Chemulpo. I could not tell
whether my talk had any effect or not, for he said
nothing, beyond thanking me for my advice. I see
to-day that it has had no effect. So now I beg you to
try.”</p>

<p>“But if you failed, how could I hope to succeed?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you why. In the first place because you
are the cause of this change of attitude on the part of
Mr. Hemster.”</p>

<p>“I the cause?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. He has undoubtedly a great liking for
you, in spite of the fact that he has known you so short
a time. In some unexplainable way he has come to
look at his daughter through your eyes, and I think he
is startled at the vision he has seen. But he does not
take sufficient account of the fact that he is not dealing
now with a little girl, but with a grown woman. I noticed
the gradual change in his manner during our stay
at the Palace, and it became much more marked on the
way back to Chemulpo, after we had left you alone battling
with the savages of Seoul. You have said you
were in no real danger, but Mr. Hemster did not think
so, and he seemed greatly impressed by the fact that a
comparative stranger should cheerfully insist on jeopardizing
his life for the safety of our party, and to my
deep anxiety his demeanour toward his daughter was at
first severe and then harsh, for he roundly accused her
of being the cause of our difficulties. I shall pass over
the storm that ensued, merely saying that it took our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
whole force to prevent Miss Hemster from returning
to Seoul.”</p>

  <div class="captionr"><a href="#Page_192"><i>Page 192</i></a>
</div></div>

<p>“Great Heavens!” I exclaimed, “surely that was
mere pretence on her part; sheer bravado.”</p>

<p>“Not altogether. It was grim determination to do
the thing that would immediately hurt her father, and I
do not know what would have happened if she had escaped
from us. It had the instant effect of subduing
him, bringing him practically to his knees before her.
So she sulked all the way to Chemulpo, and I expected
that the brief assumption of authority had ended; but
while we were rowing out to the yacht he spoke very
sharply to her, and I saw with regret that his determination
was at least equal to hers. Therefore I spoke to
him after she had gone to her room, and he said very
little one way or the other. Now he appears to think
that as he has got her safely on his yacht once more he
can bend her to his will, and I am terrified at the outlook.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t look enticing, does it?”</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t, so won’t you please talk with him
for his own sake?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather face the Emperor of Corea again, or his
amiable subjects in mass meeting assembled, but I’ll
do it for your sake. Oh, yes, and for his sake, too; I
would do anything I could to make matters easy for
Mr. Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” said the girl simply, leaning
back in her chair with a sigh of contentment. “Now
let us talk of something else.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart, Hilda. I’ve been wanting to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
talk of something else ever since your very abrupt departure
last night. Now am I over-confident in taking
your last brief action there as equivalent to the monosyllable
‘Yes’?”</p>

<p>The girl laughed and coloured, visibly embarrassed.
She darted a quick glance at me, then veiled her eyes
again.</p>

<p>“The brief action, as you call it, seems rather impulsive
now in the glare of daylight, and was equivalent
to much more than the monosyllable ‘Yes’. Three
times as much. It was equivalent to the trisyllable
‘Sympathy.’ I was merely expressing sympathy.”</p>

<p>“Was that all?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that more than enough? I have thought
since, with shame, that my action was just a trifle over-bold,
and I fear you are of the same opinion, although
too kind-hearted to show it.”</p>

<p>“My whole thought was a protest against its
brevity.”</p>

<p>“But brevity is the soul of wit, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Hilda,” said I, leaning forward toward her,
“but not the soul of kissing. If my right arm had not
temporarily lost its power you had never escaped with
the celerity you did. ‘Man wants but little here below,’
and I want that little monosyllable rather than the large
trisyllable. Make me for ever happy by saying you
meant it.”</p>

<p>“For ever is a long time,” she answered dreamily,
her eyes partially closed.</p>

<p>“<em>Miss Stretton, will you oblige me by going downstairs;
I wish to talk to Mr. Tremorne.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>The words, sharp and decisive, cut like a knife, and,
starting to my feet in amazement, I saw that Gertrude
Hemster stood before us, her brow a thundercloud.
Turning from her beautiful but forbidding countenance
to see the effect of her peremptory sentence upon
my dear companion, I found the chair empty, and the
space around me vacant as if she had vanished into
invisibility through the malign incantation of a sorceress.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“Will</span> you be seated, Miss Hemster?” I
said with such calmness as I could
bring to my command.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” she snapped, like the click of a rifle.</p>

<p>I don’t know why it is that this girl always called
forth hitherto unsuspected discourtesy which I regret
to admit seems to lie very deep in my nature. I was
bitterly angry at her rude dismissal of Hilda Stretton.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well; stand then!” I retorted with inexcusable
lack of chivalry, and, that my culpability should
be complete, immediately slammed myself emphatically
down into the chair from which I had just risen. As I
came down with a thump that made the wicker chair
groan in protest, the look the lady bestowed upon me
must have resembled that of the Medusa which turned
people into stone.</p>

<p>“Well, you <em>are</em> polite, I must say,” she exclaimed,
with a malicious swish of her skirts as she walked to
and fro before me.</p>

<p>“You so monopolize all politeness on board this
yacht,” was my unmannerly rejoinder, “that there is
none of it left for the rest of us.”</p>

<p>She stopped in her rapid walk and faced me.</p>

<p>“You’re a brute,” she said deliberately.</p>

<p>“You expressed that opinion before. Why not try
something original?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think that is a gentlemanly remark to
make?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. Some years of vagabondage coupled
with more recent events have destroyed all claim I ever
possessed to being a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“You admit, then, you are the scum of the earth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she flounced herself down in the chair
Hilda had occupied, and stared at me for a few moments.
Then she said in a voice much modified:</p>

<p>“What were you and Miss Stretton discussing so
earnestly when I came up?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you hear?”</p>

<p>“No. I am no eavesdropper, but I know you were
talking of me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you didn’t hear.”</p>

<p>“I told you I didn’t, but I tell you what I suspect.”</p>

<p>“Then your suspicions are entirely unfounded, Miss
Hemster.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it, but I’ll say this for you; however
much of a beast you may be, you are rather unhandy
at a lie; so if you wish to convince me that you
are speaking the truth, you must tell me, without taking
time to consider, what you were talking about if you
were not talking of me.”</p>

<p>All this was uttered at lightning speed.</p>

<p>“I need no time for consideration to answer that
question. We were talking of ourselves.”</p>

<p>“What were you saying? Come now, out with it if
you dare. I can see by your face you are trying to
make up something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>“Really, you underestimate my courage, Miss Hemster.
I was asking Hilda Stretton to do me the honour
of marrying me, and she was about to reply when you
cut short a conference so absorbing that we had not
noticed your approach.”</p>

<p>This explanation seemed to be so unexpected that for
a moment the young woman sat breathless and expressionless.
Then she gradually sank back in her chair
with closed eyes, all colour leaving her face.</p>

<p>Now, I am well aware of the effect the words just
written will have on the mind of the indulgent reader.
She will think I’m trying to hint that the girl, despite
her actions, was in love with me. I beg to state that
I am no such conceited ass as the above paragraph
would imply. My wife has always held that Gertrude
Hemster <em>was</em> in love with me, but that is merely the
prejudiced view of an affectionate woman, and I have
ever strenuously combated it. The character of Gertrude
Hemster has for long been a puzzle to me, and
I can hardly expect the credence of the reader when I
say that I have toned down her words and actions
rather than exaggerated them. But my own theory of
the case is this: Miss Hemster had an inordinate love
of conquest and power. I think I should have got
along better with her if I had proposed to her and
taken my rejection in a broken and contrite spirit.
That she would have rejected me, I am as positive as
that I breathe. I am equally certain that, while she
would have scorned to acknowledge me as a favoured
lover, she was nevertheless humiliated to know that I
had given preference to one upon whom she rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
looked down,&mdash;one whom she regarded as a recipient
of her own bounty,&mdash;and the moment I made my confession
I was sorry I had done so, for Hilda’s sake.</p>

<p>It has also been hinted,&mdash;I shall not say by whom,&mdash;that
I was on a fair way of being in love with Gertrude
Hemster if everything had progressed favourably. I
need hardly point out to the reader the utter erroneousness
of this surmise. I do not deny that during the
first day of our acquaintance I was greatly attracted
by her, or perhaps I should say wonderfully interested
in her. I had never met any one just like her before,
nor have I since for that matter. But that I was even
on the verge of being in love with her I emphatically
deny. I have no hesitation in confessing that she was
the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, when it
pleased her to be gracious. She would certainly have
made a superb actress if Fortune had cast her rôle
upon the stage. But, as I have said, I never understood
this woman, or comprehended her lightning
changes of character. I do not know to this day
whether she was merely a shallow vixen or a creature
of deep though uncontrolled passion. I therefore
content myself with setting down here, as accurately
as possible, what happened on the various occasions of
which I speak, so that each reader may draw her own
conclusions, if indeed there are any conclusions to be
drawn, and I do this as truthfully as may be, at the
risk of some misunderstanding of my own position, as
in the present instance.</p>

<p>The silence which followed my announcement was at
last broken by a light sarcastic laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Tremorne,” she said, “it is not very
flattering to me to suppose that I am interested in the
love affairs of the servants’ hall.”</p>

<p>I bowed my acknowledgment of this thrust.</p>

<p>“My statement, Miss Hemster, was not made for
your entertainment, or with any hope that it would engage
your attention, but merely as an answer to your
direct question.”</p>

<p>“So two penniless paupers are going to unite their
fortunes!”</p>

<p>“Penniless, only relatively so; paupers, no.”</p>

<p>“Nothing added to nothing makes how much, Mr.
Tremorne?”</p>

<p>“Madam, I am an Oxford man.”</p>

<p>“What has that to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Much. Cambridge is the mathematical university.
I never was good at figures.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that’s why you threw away your money.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Still, the money I threw away yesterday
belonged to your father.”</p>

<p>“Is that to remind me of the debt I am supposed to
owe you?”</p>

<p>“You owe me nothing. If anybody owes me anything
I am certain Mr. Hemster will discharge the debt
with his usual generosity.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are counting on that, are you?”</p>

<p>“We have Biblical assurance, Miss Hemster, of the
fact that the labourer is worthy of his hire. My hire is
all I expect, and all I shall accept.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is my hope that your term of employment
will be as short as possible; therefore I ask you to resign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
your position as soon as we reach Nagasaki. Your
presence on this ship is odious to me.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for that.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t resign?”</p>

<p>“I say that I am sorry my presence on this ship is
odious to you.”</p>

<p>“You can at once solve the problem by resigning, as
I have suggested.”</p>

<p>“I dispute your right to make suggestions to me.
If you want me to leave the yacht, ask your father to
discharge me.”</p>

<p>“There is always a certain humiliation in abrupt dismissal.
If you do not go voluntarily, and without
telling my father that I have asked you to resign, I
shall put Hilda Stretton ashore at Nagasaki with
money enough to pay her passage home.”</p>

<p>“How generous of you! First-class or steerage?”</p>

<p>Her face became a flame of fire, and she clenched her
hands till the nails bit the pink palms.</p>

<p>“You sneaking reptile!” she cried, her voice trembling
with anger; “you backbiting, underhand beast!
What lies have you dared tell my father about me?”</p>

<p>“You are under some strange misapprehension, Miss
Hemster,” I replied, with a coolness which earned my
mental approbation, fervently hoping at the same time
that I might continue to maintain control over my deplorable
temper; “you have jumped at a conclusion
not borne out by fact. I assure you I have never discussed
you with your father, and should not venture to
do so.”</p>

<p>I remembered the moment I had spoken that I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
just promised another lady to do that very thing.
What everybody says must be true when they state that
my thoughts are awkward and ungainly, rarely coming
up to the starting-point until too late. I fear this tardy
recollection brought the colour to my face, for the
angry eyes of the girl were upon me, and she evidently
misread this untimely flushing. She leaned across the
little wicker table and said in a calm, unruffled voice,
marked with the bitterness of hate:</p>

<p>“You are a liar.”</p>

<p>I rose to my feet with the intention of leaving her,
but she sprang up with a nimbleness superior to my
own, and before I was aware of what she was about she
thrust her two hands against my breast and plumped
me unexpectedly down into my chair again. It was a
ludicrous and humiliating situation, but I was too
angry to laugh about it. Standing over me, she hissed
down at me:</p>

<p>“You heard what I said.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, and I am resolved that there shall be no
further communication between us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you? Well, you’ll listen to what I have
to say, or I’ll add ‘coward’ to ‘liar.’ Either you or
Hilda Stretton has been poisoning my father’s mind
against me. Which was it?”</p>

<p>“It was I, of course.”</p>

<p>“Then you admit you are a liar?”</p>

<p>“‘All men are liars,’ said the Psalmist, so why
should I be an exception?”</p>

<p>“You are very good at quoting the Bible, aren’t
you? Why don’t you live up to it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>“I should be the better man if I did.”</p>

<p>“Will you resign at Nagasaki, then?”</p>

<p>“I shall do exactly what your father orders me
to do.”</p>

<p>“That is precisely the answer I should have expected
from a mud-wallower who came to us from the gutter.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. I lived up on a hill.”</p>

<p>“Well, I give you warning, that if you don’t leave
this yacht you will regret it.”</p>

<p>“I shall probably regret the tender memories of your
conversation, Miss Hemster; but if you think to
frighten me I beg to point out that it is really yourself
who is in danger, as you might know if experience
taught the class of persons it is said to teach. You
have called me a brute and a beast and all the rest of it,
and have partly persuaded me that you are right.
Now the danger to you lies in the fact that you will go
just a step too far on one of these occasions, and then I
shall pick you up and throw you overboard. Now allow
me to say that you have about reached the limit,
likewise to inform you that I shall not resign.”</p>

<p>I now arose, confronting her, and flung the wicker
chair to the other side of the deck. Then, taking off
my hat, I left her standing there.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I am</span> tired of my own shortcomings, and I have no
doubt the reader is also, if she has read this far.
I shall therefore make no attempt to excuse my
language toward Gertrude Hemster. The heated conversation
in which we indulged had, however, one effect
upon my future course. I resolved not to say a
word to her father against his treatment of her.
Whatever the old gentleman had said to her, it could
not have been cruder or ruder than the language which
I had myself employed. Therefore I felt it would be
ludicrous for me to act the part of censor or adviser.
I had shown my own unfitness for either of those rôles.
Besides this, I had been convinced that Hilda Stretton
was entirely mistaken in thinking that the young
woman would commit suicide or do any injury to herself.
My summing up of her character led me to the
belief that although she would be quite willing to inflict
pain upon others, she would take good care not to act
to her own discomfort. Seizing the first opportunity
that presented itself, I told Miss Stretton my determination,
and, while she did not agree with me, she made
no effort to induce me to forego my resolution.</p>

<p>The bustle pertaining to our safe arrival at Nagasaki
drove all other subjects from my mind, and I was inclined
to think that my recent troubles and quarrels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
arose through the well-known activity of Satan to provide
employment for idle hands. We were now busy
enough. There had accumulated at Nagasaki a mass
of letters and a bundle of cablegrams for Mr. Hemster
which required his immediate attention, and in his disposal
of these messages I caught a glimpse of the great
business man he really was. However lax he might
have proved in his conduct toward his only daughter,
he showed himself a very Napoleon in the way he faced
the problems presented to him, settling momentous
affairs thousands of miles away by the dispatch of a
code word or two.</p>

<p>In all this, so far as my abilities permitted, I was his
humble assistant, and I found myself filled with admiration
and astonishment at his powers of concentration
and the brilliancy of his methods. The little
naphtha launch was kept running backward and forward
between the yacht and the telegraph office, and
during the long day that followed our arrival at Nagasaki
that roll-top desk was a centre of commercial activity
vastly different in its efficiency from the lazy
routine to which I had been accustomed in the diplomatic
service. My own nervous tension kept me going
until the long day had passed, and the time seemed as
but a few minutes. At the end I was as tired as if I
had spent twelve hours continuously on the football
field, and for the first time in my life I realized how
men are burnt up in their pursuit of the mighty dollar.
My natural inclination was to doubt whether the
game was worth the candle, but during the progress of
the game there was no question, for it held on the alert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
every faculty a man possessed, and I could well believe
that it might exert a fascination that indulgence in mere
gambling could never equal.</p>

<p>Silas K. Hemster himself was like a man transformed;
the eyes which I had hitherto considered dull
and uninteresting became aglow with the excitement
of battle. His face was keen, stern, and relentless; I
saw he was an enemy who gave no quarter and expected
none. His orders to me were sharp and decisive,
and I no more thought of questioning them than
of offering unsought advice regarding them. He was
like an exiled monarch come again to his throne; for
the first time in our brief acquaintance I had seen the
real Hemster, and the sight had given me a feeling of
my own inane inadequacy in the scheme of things here
below. When at last the day was done, his face relaxed,
and he leaned back in his swivel chair, regarding
me with eyes that had taken on their old kindliness.
He seemed enlivened rather than exhausted by the contest,
as if he had taken a sip of the elixir of youth.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy,” he said, “you’re tired out. You
look as if you had been running a race.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I’ve been doing, sir.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman laughed.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” he mused ruminatingly, “did we have
lunch or not?”</p>

<p>“You consumed a sandwich which I placed on your
desk, Mr. Hemster, and I bolted another during one
of my rushes for the dispatch-boat.”</p>

<p>Again he laughed.</p>

<p>“I had forgotten,” he said, “but we will enjoy our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
dinner all the more when we sit down to it. Confess
that you’re used up.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I don’t feel just as active as I did in the
morning.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman shook his head with a slow motion
that had something of pity in it.</p>

<p>“You English have no aptitude for business. It
shows the decadent state of Europe that Britain has
held supremacy on that continent for so long.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry, sir, if you took me for a typical
example of the English business man. I doubt if in
any respect I am a credit to my country, still I am not
such an idiot as to suppose I shine as a man of affairs.
My training has been against me, even if I had any
natural aptitude for commerce, which I doubt. Still,
we are supposed to possess some creditable captains of
industry on our little island.”</p>

<p>“Supposed! That’s just it, and the supposition
holds good until they are up against something better.
Now, if you were in Chicago, and you wished me to
join you in a deal while I was cruising on the coast of
Japan, what would you do?”</p>

<p>“I should write you a letter explaining the project
I had to put before you.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. You wouldn’t go to the expense of
cabling the whole thing, would you?”</p>

<p>“If the scheme was important enough I might go
to that cost.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman held in his hand two or three
cable messages which I had not seen, also a letter or
two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, here is a man,” he said, “who has hit upon
a plan I have often thought of myself. He has, he
tells me, made a combination which possesses considerable
strength, but in order to be impregnable he
needs my co-operation. He cables the points very concisely,
and puts his case with a good deal of power;
but that cablegram is merely an advance agent for himself,
expensive as it is. His object is to hold me at
Yokohama until he can arrive. He actually crosses
the continent to San Francisco, and takes the first
steamer for Japan. I received his cablegram at Yokohama,
but did not wait for him. I sent off a word or
two myself to Chicago, asking confidential information
which I have now received. Just before we left for
Corea I got a telegram from this man in Yokohama,
asking me to wait for him at Nagasaki, which I did not
do, because I wished to impress on the energetic individual
that I was not anxious to fall in with his plan,
and I knew that, having come so far, he would not return
without seeing me. Meanwhile I determined to
find out whether his combination is as strong as he said
it was, and this information is now in my possession.
Also, I wished on my own account to make a combine
so formidable that whether I gave my adherence to the
one or the other my weight would tip the beam in favour
of the one I joined. This combination also has
been completed, and I hold the balance, of course.
Our friend who has come over from Japan probably
does not know that there is any opposition to his
scheme, and no one in the world except yourself and
myself and a man in Chicago knows I have anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
to do with the other combine. You see I am just
yachting for pleasure and for health, and am reluctant
to touch business at all. At least, that is the information
which I intend to be imparted to our friend, who
is now impatiently awaiting me at the Nagasaki Hotel.
You might think that I should invite him to come
aboard my yacht and talk the matter over, or that I
should go ashore and visit him, which he asks me to
do; but I shall do neither. You see I want Mr. John
C. Cammerford to realize that he is not nearly so important
in the commercial affairs of America as he supposes
himself to be.”</p>

<p>“John C. Cammerford!” I cried in amazement.
“I think I have met him in New York, though it may
not be the same man.”</p>

<p>“Well, the name is not a common one, and if you know
him, all the better. I now instruct you to call on him
first thing to-morrow morning. You will notice that
I have trusted you fully in this matter by giving you
information which must not leak through to Cammerford.
You will tell him, however, that his combination
is not the only one in the United States, and if I’m
to join his he must prove to me that it is stronger than
the opposition. He must give you a list of the firms
he has combined, and he will have to show you the
original documents pertaining to the options he has received.
I want to know how long his options last.
They will probably have at least six months’ life, or he
could never have taken this journey to see me. If he
satisfies you that his combination is genuine, and that
his options have still several months to run, then I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
consent to meet him. If he cannot do this, or if he
refuses to do it, I shall send a few cables which will
certainly upset his apple-cart before he reaches San
Francisco. You will not promise anything on my behalf,
and I should have no objection if he imagines
that my lack of eagerness in meeting him is caused by
the fact that the other combination appears to me the
stronger.”</p>

<p>“Would you mind my sending to him your card instead
of my own? He might possibly refuse to meet
me if I sent in the name of Tremorne.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Use my card if you wish. The
main point is that you get as much information as possible,
and give as little in return as may be. There’s
the dinner gong, and I’m quite ready to meet whatever’s
on the table. Come along.”</p>

<p>Next morning after breakfast I went ashore, and,
arriving at the Nagasaki Hotel, sent up Mr. Hemster’s
card to Mr. John C. Cammerford, and was promptly
admitted to his presence. He occupied what I took to
be the finest suite of rooms in the hotel, and had a large
table placed near the principal window of his sitting-room,
so that his back was to the light, which shone
full on the face of any visitor who called upon him. It
was quite evident to me that Mr. Cammerford hoped
to impress Silas K. Hemster with the fact that he was
carrying on great affairs right here in Japan similar to
those that occupied his attention in Chicago. The table
was littered with papers, and Cammerford sat busily
writing as if every moment was of importance. All
his plans for the impression of a visitor fell to pieces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
like a house of cards when the astonished man saw
who was approaching him. He sprang to his feet with
a cry of dismay and backed toward the window. From
his position I could not very well read the expression
on his face, but it seemed to be one of fear.</p>

<p>“I’m expecting another man,” he cried, “you have
no right here. Get out.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Cammerford, I have a
right here, and I have come to talk business.”</p>

<p>“What are you following me for? Why are you
here?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I am here as the representative of Silas K. Hemster,
of Chicago, and with his permission I sent up his
card to you.”</p>

<p>Gradually his self-possession returned to him, but he
took care to keep the table between himself and me.
He indulged in a little cynical laugh.</p>

<p>“You took me by surprise, Mr. Tremorne. I&mdash;I
thought perhaps you intended trying to collect&mdash;a&mdash;a
little account of your own.”</p>

<p>“No, I came entirely on Mr. Hemster’s behalf.
Have I your permission to be seated?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Sit down, sit down,” and, saying this
with an effort at bluff geniality, he placed himself in
the chair he had so abruptly vacated.</p>

<p>“I thought, as I said before,” he added, with another
uneasy laugh, “that you had some notion of collecting
a little money from me. The last time we met you held
a very mistaken view of the business matter in which
we had been associated. I assure you now&mdash;you
wouldn’t listen then&mdash;that everything done was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
strictly legal, and no one was more sorry than I that
the deal did not prove as successful as we had both
hoped.”</p>

<p>“You cover me with confusion, Mr. Cammerford.
I have no remembrance that I ever disputed the legality
of the transaction, and I deeply regret that I seem to
have permitted myself at the time to use harsh language
which you are quite justified in deploring. If
it is any comfort to you, I beg to assure you that I
look upon the half-million dollars as irretrievably lost,
and at this hour yesterday had no more idea you were
in Japan than you had that I was, if you did me the
honour to think of me.”</p>

<p>Cammerford gazed doubtfully across the table at me,
as if he feared there was something sinister behind all
this show of submission.</p>

<p>“It was you, then, who sent up Mr. Hemster’s
card?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He asked me to see you.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t he come himself? Is he ill?”</p>

<p>“No, he never was in better health,” I answered;
“but he is exceedingly busy. I am by way of being
his confidential man, and if you can prove to me that
the claims you have made are real, I shall have much
pleasure in arranging an interview between you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s how the land lies, is it? What do you
know of my proposals to Mr. Hemster?”</p>

<p>“I have read all your letters and telegrams relating
to the matter this morning; in fact, I have them in my
pocket now.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemster seems to repose great trust in you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
That is rather unusual with him. I suppose you have
some document to prove that you are empowered to
deal?”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact I am not empowered to deal.
I am merely the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">avant coureur</i> of Mr. Hemster. I sent
you up his card, and here are your own letters, telegrams,
and cablegrams. I was told to inform you that
since you have left America another combination which
Mr. Hemster considers nearly if not quite as strong as
your own has been put through, and Mr. Hemster has
been invited to join. He is well acquainted with the
person who has effected the second combination, but,
as you have just intimated, Mr. Hemster is not a man
to allow personal considerations to deflect him from the
strict business path. If you can show that your combination
is the stronger, I can guarantee that you will
have opportunity of speaking with Mr. Hemster. If
not, he sails away to-morrow in his yacht, and deprives
himself of the pleasure of meeting you, as you happen
to be an entire stranger to him.”</p>

<p>“How am I to show him all this if he refuses to
see me?”</p>

<p>“You are to convince me of two things by exhibiting
the original documents: first, that these firms mentioned
in your letters have given you options; and
second, the length of the options,&mdash;the date on which
they expire, in fact.”</p>

<p>“And if I refuse?” said Cammerford, seemingly
puzzled and displeased at the trend of our conversation.</p>

<p>I rose to my feet and bowed to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>“If you refuse,” I said, “that ends my mission.
Good-morning to you.”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit, wait a bit,” cried Cammerford, “sit
down, Mr. Tremorne. This requires a little thought.
Please don’t go; just sit down for a moment. I don’t
see how Mr. Hemster can expect me to show my whole
hand to one who, begging your pardon, is a comparative
stranger, and one who will have nothing to do with
our transaction. Secrecy is the very soul of such a
deal as I am trying to put through. What guarantee
have I that you will not cable to New York or Chicago
full particulars of what I am asked to tell you.”</p>

<p>“None whatever, Mr. Cammerford.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s not business.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. Then I shall report your opinion to Mr.
Hemster.”</p>

<p>“What’s his object? Why doesn’t he come and
see me himself?”</p>

<p>“I think I may go so far as to say that he wishes
to know whether or not it is worth his while to meet
you. You see, Mr. Cammerford, you are a stranger to
him. He was good enough to hint that if I reported
favourably on your scheme, he would wait over a day
or two and go into the matter with you. As I have
said, he is exceedingly busy. I left him immersed in
letters and cablegrams, and all day yesterday we were
over head and ears in matters of rather large importance.
If you had been his Chicago acquaintance who
formed the other combine, I imagine he would have
seen you; as it is, he has sent me.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, look here, Tremorne,” cried Cammerford,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
with a fine assumption of honest bluffness, “let
us talk as man to man. We’re not school-boys or sentimental
girls. You know as well as I do that there is
not one chance in ten million for my seeing old Hemster
if the choice in the matter lies with you. You are
exceedingly polite, and speak as sweetly as molasses,
but I wasn’t born yesterday, and am not such a darned
fool as to suppose you are going to put in a good word
for me.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right, Mr. Cammerford; I shall put
in no good word for you that I can possibly keep out.
Nevertheless I shall report fairly to Mr. Hemster exactly
what you place before me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all guff. You’ll knife me because
you’ve got the chance to do it. I quite admit it will
be done with smooth talk, but it will be effective nevertheless.”</p>

<p>“If you believe that, Mr. Cammerford, I shall make
no endeavour to convince you of the contrary. You
will act, of course, as best serves your own interest.
Personally I do not care a halfpenny whether the great
beef combine is formed in the interest of the dear public,
or goes to smash through the non-agreement of its
promoters. I fancy you cannot float such a trust and
leave Mr. Hemster out, but you know more about that
than I. Now it’s your next move. What are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>Cammerford leaned across the table, showing me his
crafty eyes narrowing as he seemed trying to find out
what my game really was. I knew exactly where his
error lay in dealing with me. He could not believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
that I was honestly trying to serve my employer, and
so he was bound to go wrong in any assumption formed
by taking such false premises for granted.</p>

<p>“See here, Tremorne, I’m going to talk straight
business to you. Whatever may be our pretences, we
are none of us engaged in this for our health; we want
to make money. I want to make money; Hemster
wants to make money; don’t <em>you</em> want to make
money?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I replied, “that’s what I’m here for.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re shouting,” exclaimed Cammerford,
an expression of great relief coming into his face. He
thought that at last he had reached firm ground. “I
confess, then,” he went on, “that it is supremely important
I should meet Hemster, and he should be favourably
disposed toward me. It is not likely I should
have taken a journey clear from New York to Nagasaki
if there wasn’t a good deal at stake. You see, I’m
perfectly frank with you. You’ve got the drop on me.
Just now my hands are right up toward the ceiling, and
I’m willing to do the square thing. Did you know
whom you were going to meet when you left the
yacht?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemster mentioned my name to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he did.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him anything of our former dealings?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not.”</p>

<p>“He does know you lost half a million in the States
a while since?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he knows that, but he doesn’t know
you’re the man who got it.”</p>

<p>“Hang it all, Tremorne; don’t put it that way.
I’m not the man who got it; I lost money as well as
you did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon; I thought we were talking
frankly and honestly to each other. Well, be that
as it may, Mr. Hemster knows I lost the money, but
he doesn’t know you’re the man who was so unfortunate
as to be in the business with me.”</p>

<p>“Well now, Tremorne, I’ll tell you what I’ll do.
You say nothing of this former company of ours, and
if you will report favourably on what I have to tell you
so that old Hemster will come and see me, or allow me
to go to him, I’ll give you two hundred thousand dollars
cash as soon as our deal is completed.”</p>

<p>“I refuse it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t trust me?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not, but I refuse it nevertheless. I should
refuse it if you offered me the money here and now.”</p>

<p>Cammerford leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>“You want to go the whole hog?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said I.</p>

<p>“You want the whole five hundred thousand or
nothing. Well, I tell you at once I can’t afford to give
that much. I’ll raise fifty thousand dollars, and make
the total amount two hundred and fifty; but I can’t
go a cent more, and there is no use trying to bluff me.”</p>

<p>“I am not trying to bluff you, Mr. Cammerford. I
should refuse the bribe if you made it five hundred
thousand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not a bribe at all, it’s&mdash;well, whatever
you like to call it. Restitution if you prefer to put it
that way.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter what it is called, I have come for
the purpose of hearing what you have to say regarding
the great beef combine. If you have nothing to say
I shall leave, because, as I told you, Mr. Hemster has a
good deal of work on his hands, and I’m trying to
help him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cammerford, in a hopeless tone of
voice, “you are the darndest fool I ever met in my
life.”</p>

<p>“You are not the first person who has said as much,
Mr. Cammerford, although not in precisely the same
language. Now, for the last time, give me a list of
the names of those who are behind you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that if you will promise me not to say anything
to old Hemster about our former relations.”</p>

<p>“I regret that I cannot make you any such promise,
Mr. Cammerford. It is my duty to lay before Mr.
Hemster everything you place before me, and it is also
my duty to warn him that I consider you as big a
scoundrel as you consider me a fool.”</p>

<p>“That’s plain talk,” said Cammerford, scowling.</p>

<p>“I intend it to be. Now, without further loss of
time, let me see your documents.”</p>

<p>For some minutes Cammerford maintained silence,
a heavy frown on his brow, and his eyes fixed on the
carpet beneath the table. At last he muttered, “Well,
I’m damned!”&mdash;and, taking a bundle of papers from
before him, he slipped off the elastic band, picked out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
one after another which he perused with care, then
handed them across the table to me, watching me very
narrowly as he did so. I took the papers one by one
and read them over, making a note with my pencil now
and then in my pocket-book. They proved to be exactly
what he had said they were in his letter to Mr.
Hemster. I pushed them back toward him again,
saying:</p>

<p>“I see by some of these documents that the option is
for six months, but others make no mention of the time.
Why is that?”</p>

<p>“Because we have bought the businesses and the options
are ours for ever.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything to prove that?”</p>

<p>Without further reply he selected several other
papers and presented them to me. These also were
satisfactory.</p>

<p>“I shall report to Mr. Hemster that your position
appears to be quite as strong as you stated it to be, and
so I wish you good-morning, Mr. Cammerford.”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses a minute,” he cried, seeing me
about to arise. “As you have asked me a whole lot of
questions, I’d like you to answer a few of mine.
Who’s in this other combine?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of it, except that it is in existence.”</p>

<p>“Do you imagine it’s a bluff?”</p>

<p>“I tell you I don’t know. I should think Mr.
Hemster is not a man to engage in bluff.”</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t he? That shows how little you know of
him. Have you been with him ever since he left Chicago?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been in his employ?”</p>

<p>“That is a private matter, Mr. Cammerford, which
concerns no one but myself and Mr. Hemster. Besides,
to tell you the truth, I came here to receive information,
not to impart it; so it is useless to question
me further.”</p>

<p>“Oh, one more won’t do any harm,” said Cammerford,
rising when I had risen; “do you think old Hemster
will consent to see me?”</p>

<p>“I am almost certain that he will.”</p>

<p>“Through your recommendation, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I shall strongly advise him not to see you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned if I understand your game.
It’s either too deep or too mighty shallow for me.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t occur to you, Mr. Cammerford, that
there’s no game at all, and therefore there can be
neither depth nor shallowness. You are troubling
your mind about what does not exist.”</p>

<p>“Then I am forced to take refuge in my former assumption,
not at all a flattering one, which is that
you’re a fool.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s the safest position to assume, Mr.
Cammerford; so, finally, good-bye.”</p>

<p>I left the man standing at the head of the stairs, his
hands on the banister, gazing after me with an expression
of great discontent.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> I arrived at the landing I saw the little
naphtha launch making a trip from the
yacht to the shore. As it swung to the
steps I noticed that Gertrude Hemster was aboard with
her new companion, a Japanese lady, said to be of extremely
high rank, whom the girl had engaged on the
first day of our arrival at Nagasaki, when her father
was so deeply immersed in business. The old gentleman
told me later that his daughter had taken an unfortunate
dislike to Miss Stretton, and had very rapidly
engaged this person, who, it was, alleged, could
speak Chinese, Japanese, Corean, and pidgin English.</p>

<p>In spite of what her father had said, I thought the
engaging of this woman with so many lingual advantages
was rather a stroke aimed at myself than an action
deposing Hilda Stretton. I suppose Miss Hemster
thought to give proof that I was no longer necessary as
interpreter on board the yacht. I doubted the accomplishments
of the Japanese high dame, thinking it impossible
to select such a treasure on such short notice,
and so the evening before had ventured to address her
in Corean; but she answered me very demurely and
correctly in that language, with a little oblique smile,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
which showed that she knew why I had spoken to her,
and I saw that I had been mistaken in slighting her
educational capacities.</p>

<p>I went down the steps and proffered my escort to the
young woman, but she was so earnestly engaged in
thanking the crew of the naphtha launch that she quite
ignored my presence. She sprang lightly up the steps
and walked away to the nearest ’rickshaw, followed by
the toddling Japanese creature. The boat’s crew, who
were champions of Miss Hemster to a man, each embued
with intense admiration for her, as was right and
natural, may or may not have noticed her contemptuous
treatment of me; but after all it did not much matter,
so I stepped into the launch and we set out for the
yacht.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Hemster immersed in his papers as
usual. Apparently he had never been on deck to get
a breath of fresh air since his steamship arrived in the
harbour.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said shortly, looking up; “you saw Mr.
Cammerford?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did he give down or hold up?”</p>

<p>“He seemed very much startled when he saw me,
and I had some difficulty in getting him to discuss the
matter in hand.”</p>

<p>“Was he afraid you had come to rob him, or did he
think he had got me in a corner?”</p>

<p>“No. He knew who it was that approached him,
but I should have told you, Mr. Hemster, that this is
the man who got my five hundred thousand dollars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
some years ago, and he was under the mistaken impression
that I had come to wring some part of it back
from him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, he thought you were camping on his trail, did
he? What did you do?”</p>

<p>“I explained that I was there merely as your representative.
He made some objection at first to showing
his hand, as he called it; but finally, seeing that he
could not come at his desired interview with you unless
he took me into his confidence, he did so, although with
extreme reluctance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and what were your conclusions?”</p>

<p>“My conclusions are that his letter to you was perfectly
truthful. He has the following firms behind him
on a six months’ option, and these others have sold
their businesses to him outright. His position, therefore,
is all that he asserted it to be,” and with this I
placed my notes before my chief.</p>

<p>“You are thoroughly convinced of that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am; but of course you will see the papers he
has to show, and may find error or fraud where I was
unable to detect either.”</p>

<p>“All right, I shall see him then.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing further, Mr. Hemster. He offered
me two hundred thousand dollars, then two hundred
and fifty thousand, if I would conceal from you
the fact that he had formerly defrauded me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and what did you say?”</p>

<p>“I refused the money, of course.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman regarded me with an expression
full of pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sorry to mention it, Tremorne, but you are a
numskull. Why didn’t you take the money? I’m
quite able to look after myself. It doesn’t matter in the
least to me whether or not the man has cheated everyone
in the United States. If he cheats me as well, he’s
entitled to all he can make. ‘The laborer is worthy of
his hire,’ as the good Book says.”</p>

<p>As I had used this quotation to his daughter, I now
surmised that she had told her father something of our
stormy conversation.</p>

<p>“Quite true, Mr. Hemster, but the good Book also
says, ‘Avoid the very appearance of evil,’ and that I
have done by refusing his bribe.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, you don’t get anything for nothing in
this world, and I think your duty was to have closed
with his offer so long as you told me the truth about
the documents I sent you to search.”</p>

<p>“He is a man I would have nothing whatever to do
with, Mr. Hemster.”</p>

<p>“There’s where you are wrong. If he happens to
possess something I want, why in the world should I
not deal with him. His moral character is of no interest
to me. As well refuse to buy a treatise on the
English language because the bookseller drops his
‘h’s.’ I am very much disappointed in your business
capacity, Mr. Tremorne.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry I don’t come up to your expectations,
sir; but he is a man whom I should view with the utmost
distrust.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you are doing business with him, certainly.
I view everyone with distrust and never squeal if I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
cheated. Tell me about this deal with Cammerford in
which you lost your money.”</p>

<p>I related to him the circumstances of the case, which
need not be set down here. When I had finished Mr.
Hemster said slowly:</p>

<p>“If you will excuse me, Mr. Tremorne, never say
that this man swindled you. Such an expression is a
misuse of language. Everything done was perfectly
legal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that well enough. In fact he mentioned
its legality during our interview this morning.
Nevertheless, he was well aware that the mine was
valueless.”</p>

<p>“What of that? It wasn’t his business to inform
you; it was your business to find out the true worth of
the mine. You are simply blaming Cammerford for
your own carelessness. If Cammerford had not got
the money, the next man who met you would; so I
suppose he sized you up, and thought he might as well
have it, and, to tell you the truth, I quite agree with
him. Now, if I told you this bag contained a thousand
dollars in gold, would you accept my word for it without
counting the money?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I would.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman seemed taken aback by this reply,
and stared at me as if I were some new human specimen
he had not met before.</p>

<p>“You would, eh?” he cried at last. “Well, you’re
hopeless! I don’t know but you were right to refuse
his bribe. The money would not do you the least good
if you got it again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it would, Mr. Hemster. I should invest it
in Government securities, and risk not a penny of it in
any speculation.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’d have that much sense,” demurred
the old gentleman, turning again to his desk.
“However, you have served me well, even if you have
served yourself badly. I will write a letter to Cammerford
and let him know the terms on which I will join
his scheme.”</p>

<p>“You surely don’t intend to do that, Mr. Hemster,
without seeing the documents yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, have no fear; you must not think I am going
to adopt your business tactics at my age. Run away
and let Hilda give you some lunch. I shall not have
time for anything but the usual sandwich. My daughter’s
gone ashore. She wants lunch at the Nagasaki
Hotel, being tired of our ship’s fare. I’ll have this
document ready for you to take to Cammerford after
you have eaten.”</p>

<p>Nothing loth, I hurried away in search of my dear
girl, of whom I had caught only slight glimpses since
her sudden dismissal by Gertrude Hemster. I was glad
to know that we should have the ship practically to
ourselves, and I flatter myself she was not sorry either.
Lunch was not yet ready, so I easily persuaded her to
come upon deck with me, and there I placed the
chairs and table just as they had been at the moment
when Miss Hemster had come so unexpectedly upon
us.</p>

<p>“Now, Hilda,” I began when we had seated ourselves,
“I want an answer to that question.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>“What question?”</p>

<p>“You know very well what question; the answer
was just hovering on your lips when we were interrupted.”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Hilda, there was an expression in your eyes which
I had never seen before, and if your lips were about to
contradict the message they sent to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Seemed to send to you,” she interrupted with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Was it only seeming, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I’m very much disappointed
with myself. I don’t call this a courtship at all. My
idea of the preliminaries to a betrothal was a long
friendship, many moonlight walks, and conversations
about delightful topics in which both parties are interested.
I pictured myself waiting eagerly under some
rose-covered porch while the right person hurried
toward me,&mdash;on horseback for choice. And now turn
from that picture to the actuality. We have known
each other only a few days; our first conversation was
practically a quarrel; we have talked about finance, and
poverty, and a lot of repulsive things of that sort. If
I were to say, ‘Yes,’ I should despise myself ever after.
It would appear as if I had accepted the first man who
offered.”</p>

<p>“Am I the first man, Hilda? I shall never believe
it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to tell you. You ask altogether too
many questions.”</p>

<p>“Well, despite your disclaimer, I shall still insist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
that the right answer was on your lips when it and you
were so rudely chased away.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Mr. <span class="locked">Tremorne&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Rupert, if you please, Hilda!”</p>

<p>“Well, now, Prince Rupert, to show you how far
astray you may be in predicting what a woman is about
to say, I shall tell you exactly what was in my mind
when the thread of my thought was so suddenly cut
across. There were conditions, provisos, stipulations,
everything in the world except the plain and simple
‘Yes’ you seemed to anticipate.”</p>

<p>“Even in that case, Hilda, I am quite happy, because
these lead to the end. It cannot be otherwise, and all
the provisos and stipulations I agree to beforehand, so
let us get directly to the small but important word
‘Yes!’”</p>

<p>“Ah, if you agreed beforehand that would not be
legal. You could say you had not read the document,
or something of that kind, and were not in your right
mind when you signed it.”</p>

<p>“Then let us have the conditions one by one, Hilda,
if you please.”</p>

<p>“I was going to ask you to say no more at present,
but to wait until I get home. I wanted you to come to
me, and ask your question then if you were still in the
same mind.”</p>

<p>“What an absurd proviso! And how long would
that be? When shall you reach your own home?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps within a year, perhaps two years. It all
depends on the duration of Mr. Hemster’s voyage.
Of course it is quite possible that at any minute he may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
make up his mind to return. I could not leave him
alone here, but once he is in Chicago he will become so
absorbed in business that he would never miss me.”</p>

<p>“There is an uncertain quality about that proviso,
Hilda, which I don’t at all admire.”</p>

<p>“Now, you see how it is,” she answered archly;
“my very first proposition is found fault with.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, it is at once agreed to. Proceed
with the next.”</p>

<p>“The next pertains more particularly to yourself. I
suppose you have no occupation in view as yet, and
I also suppose, if you think of marrying, you do not
expect to lead a life of idleness.”</p>

<p>“Far from it.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I wish that you would offer your services
to Mr. Hemster. I am sure he has great confidence
in you, and as he grows older he will feel more
and more the need of a friend. He has had no real
friend since my father died.”</p>

<p>“You forget about yourself, Hilda.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t count; I am but a woman, and what he
needs near him is a clear-headed man who will give
him disinterested advice. That is a thing he cannot
buy, and he knows it.”</p>

<p>“I quite believe you, but nevertheless where is the
clear-headedness? He has just asserted that I am a
fool.”</p>

<p>“He surely never called you that.”</p>

<p>“Well, not that exactly, but as near as possible to it,
and somehow, now that I am sitting opposite to you, I
rather think that he is right, and I have been quixotic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>“Now I come to another condition,” Hilda said with
some perceptible hesitation. “It is not a condition exactly,
but an explanation. I have often wondered
whether I acted rightly or not in the circumstances,
and perhaps your view of the case may differ from the
conclusion at which I arrived. The one man with
whom I should most naturally have consulted in a business
difficulty&mdash;Mr. Hemster himself&mdash;was out of the
question in this case, so I tried to imagine what my
father would have had me do, and I acted accordingly,
but not without some qualms of conscience then and
since. I fear I did not do what an independent girl
should have done, but now that we have become so
friendly you shall be my judge.”</p>

<p>“You will find me a very lenient one, Hilda; in fact
the verdict is already given: you did exactly right
whatever it was.”</p>

<p>“Sir, you must not pronounce until you hear. We
approach now the dread secret of a woman with a past.
That always crops up, you know, at the critical moment.
I think I told you my father and Mr. Hemster
were friends from boyhood; that they went to school
together; that their very differences of character made
the friendship sincere and lasting. My father was a
quiet, scholarly man, fond of his books, while Mr. Hemster
cared nothing for literature or art, but only for an
outdoor life and contest with his fellow men. It is difficult
to imagine that one so sedate and self-restrained as
Mr. Hemster now seems to be should have lived the life
of a reckless cowboy on the plains, riding like a centaur,
and shooting with an accuracy that saved his life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
on more than one occasion, whatever the result to his
opponents. Nevertheless, in the midst of this wild
career he was the first, or one of the first, to realize the
future of the cattle business, and thus he laid the foundation
of the colossal fortune he now possesses. I can
imagine him the most capable man on the ranch, and I
believe he was well paid for his services and saved his
money, there being no way of spending it, for he neither
drank nor gambled. While yet a very young man an
opportunity came to him, and he had not quite enough
capital to take advantage of it. My father made up the
deficit, and, small as the amount was, Mr. Hemster has
always felt an undue sense of obligation for a loan
which was almost instantly repaid. When my father
died he left me practically penniless so far as money
was concerned, but with a musical education which
would have earned me a comfortable living. Shortly
after my father’s death the manager of our local bank
informed me that there had been deposited to my order
one hundred thousand dollars’ worth of stock in Mr.
Hemster’s great business. Now the question is, Should
I have kept that, or should I have returned it to Mr.
Hemster?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Hilda, but there is no question
there at all. Your father, by reason of his most opportune
loan, was quite honestly entitled to a share in the
business the creation of which his money had made
possible.”</p>

<p>“But the sum given to me was out of all proportion
to the amount lent. It is even more out of proportion
than the figures I have mentioned would lead you to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
suppose, for the interest paid is so great that such an
income could not be produced by four or five times the
face value of the stock. Then Mr. Hemster was under
no obligation to have given me a penny.”</p>

<p>“Surely a man may be allowed to do the right thing
without being legally bound to do it. I hope you accepted
without hesitation.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I accepted, but with considerable hesitation.
Now, I think Mr. Hemster would be greatly annoyed
if he knew I had told you all this. His own daughter
has not the slightest suspicion of it, and I imagine her
father would be even more disturbed if she gathered
any hint of the real state of affairs. Indeed, I may
tell you that she has dismissed me since this Japanese
Countess came.”</p>

<p>“Then we are in the same plight, for the young lady
ordered me to resign.”</p>

<p>“And are you going to?”</p>

<p>“Not likely. She didn’t engage me, and therefore
has no standing in the contract. But, to return to ourselves,
which is always the paramount subject of interest,
this dread secret, as you called it, puts an entirely
different complexion on our relations. You must see
that. Here have I been suing you under the impression
that you were a helpless dependent. Now you turn out
to be an heiress of the most pronounced transatlantic
type. You once accused me of being dull in comprehension.”</p>

<p>“I never did.”</p>

<p>“Well, people do accuse me of that; nevertheless I
am brilliant enough to perceive that this is a transformation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
scene, and that the dreams which I have indulged
in regarding our relationship are no longer
feasible.”</p>

<p>Hilda clasped her hands and rested her elbows on the
wicker table, leaning forward toward me with an expression
half quizzical, half pathetic.</p>

<p>“I never called you dull, Mr. <span class="locked">Tremorne&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Rupert, if you please.”</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash;but I did think you slightly original, Rupertus.
Now, your talk of all this making a great difference is
quite along the line of conventional melodrama. I see
you are about to wave me aside. ‘Rich woman, begone,’
say you. You are going out into the world,
registering a vow that until you can place dollar for
dollar on the marriage altar you will shun me. Now I
have read that sort of thing ever since I perused ‘The
Romance of a Poor Young Man,’ but I never expected
to encounter in real life this haughty, inflexible, poor
young man.”</p>

<p>“Rich woman, there are many surprises here below,
and of course you cannot avoid your share of them.
However, I shall not so haughtily wave you aside until
you have answered that important question with a
word of three letters rather than one of two. I cannot
refuse what is not proffered. So will you kindly put
me in a position to enact a haughty poor young man
by saying definitely whether you will marry me or
not?”</p>

<p>“I reply, ‘Yes, yes, yes, yes,’ and a thousand other
yes’s, if you wish them. Now, young man, what have
you to say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>“I have this to say, young woman, that your wealth
entirely changes the situation.”</p>

<p>“And I maintain it doesn’t, not a particle.”</p>

<p>“I will show you how it does. I was poor, and I
thought you were poor. Therefore it was my duty, as
you remarked, to go out into the world and wring
money from somebody. That, luckily, is no longer
necessary. Hilda, we may be married this very day.
Come, I dare you to consent.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, dropping her hands to her side
and leaning back in her creaking chair, looking critically
at me with eyes almost veiled by their long lashes,
a kindly smile, however, hovering about her pretty lips.
“You are in a hurry, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you didn’t expect to clear the way so effectively
when you spoke?”</p>

<p>Before she could reply we were interrupted by the
arrival of Mr. Hemster, who carried a long sealed envelope
in his hand. He gazed affectionately at the girl
for a moment or two, then pinched her flushed cheek.</p>

<p>“Hilda, my dear,” he said, “I never saw you looking
exactly like this before. What have you two been
talking about? Something pleasant, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we were,” replied Hilda pertly; “we were
saying what a nice man Silas K. Hemster is.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman turned his glance toward me with
something of shrewd inquiry in it.</p>

<p>“Hilda,” he said slowly, “you mustn’t believe too
much in nice men, young or old. They sometimes
prove very disappointing. Especially do I warn you
against this confidential secretary of mine. He is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
most idiotically impractical person I have ever met.
Would you believe it, my dear, that he was to-day offered
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars if he
would merely keep quiet about something he knew
which he thought was his duty to tell me, and he was
fool enough to refuse the good and useful cash?”</p>

<p>“Please tell Miss Stretton, Mr. Hemster, that the
good and useful cash bore the ugly name of bribe, and
tell her further that you would have refused it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that. I don’t want the
girl to think me quite in my dotage yet. Such a sum
is not picked up so easily every day on the streets of
Nagasaki, as I think you found out a while ago.”</p>

<p>“It may be picked up on board a yacht,” said Hilda
archly, smiling up at him.</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re getting beyond me now. I don’t
know what you mean, Hilda,” and he pinched her
cheek again.</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Tremorne, I am sorry to send you
away again without lunch, but business must be attended
to even if we have to subsist on sandwiches.
How old a man is this Cammerford?”</p>

<p>“About forty, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Does he strike you as a capable individual?”</p>

<p>“Naturally he does. He has proved himself to be
much more capable than I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s no recommendation. Well, I want you
to take this letter to him; it is my ultimatum, and you
may tell him so. He must either accept or refuse. I
shall not dicker or modify my terms. If he accepts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
then bring him right over to the yacht with you; if he
refuses, you tell him I will have him wiped out before
he can set foot in San Francisco.” He handed me the
sealed envelope.</p>

<p>“You see you were in at the beginning of this business,
so I’d like you to be on hand at the finish. I’m
sorry to make an errand-boy of you, Tremorne, but
we are a little distant from the excellent messenger
service of Chicago.”</p>

<p>I rose at once, placed the envelope in my inside
pocket, and said:</p>

<p>“I shall do my best, Mr. Hemster, although, as you
have remarked, I seem to be little more than a messenger-boy
in the negotiations.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all; you’re ambassador, that’s what you
are; a highly honourable position, and I feel certain
that as you are not particularly fond of Cammerford
your manner will go far toward showing him his own
insignificance. When he once realizes how powerless
he is, we’ll have no further difficulty with him.”</p>

<p>I laughed, received a sweet smile from Hilda and a
kindly nod from Hemster, then turned to the gangway
and was in the ever-ready naptha launch a moment
later.</p>

<p>Cammerford was not expecting me, so I had to
search for him, and at last ran him down at the equivalent
of the American bar which Nagasaki possesses for
the elimination of loneliness from the children of the
Spread Eagle.</p>

<p>“Have a drink with me, Tremorne,” cried Cammerford,
as genially as if we were the oldest possible
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks, no!” I replied. “I’d sooner meet the
muzzle of a revolver than imbibe the alleged American
drinks they furnish at this place. You see, I know
the town; besides, I’ve come on business.”</p>

<p>“Ah, is the old man going to see me, then?”</p>

<p>“That will depend on your answer to his letter
which I have here in my pocket. May I suggest an
adjournment to your rooms in the hotel?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly,” muttered Cammerford hastily,
evidently all aquiver with excitement and anxiety.</p>

<p>When we reached his apartments he thrust out his
hand eagerly for the letter, which I gave to him. He
ripped it open on the instant, and, standing by the window,
read it through to the end, then, tossing it on the
table, he threw back his head and gave utterance to a
peal of laughter which had an undercurrent of relief
in it.</p>

<p>“I was to tell you,” said I, as soon as I could make
myself heard, “that this document is by way of being
an ultimatum, and if you do not see fit to accept <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;”</span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right, my dear boy,” he cried, interrupting
me. “Accept it? Of course I do, but first I
must tender an abject apology to you.”</p>

<p>“There is no necessity, Mr. Cammerford,” I protested,
“I hope that is not a proviso in the communication?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear boy, it is not. I offer the apology
most sincerely on my own initiative. Actually I took
you for a fool, but you are a damned sight shrewder
man than I am. I told you when you were here that I
could not get on to your game, but now I see it straight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
as a string, and I wonder I was such a chump as not to
suspect it before. Tremorne, you’re a genius. Of
course your proper way of working was through the
old man with that cursed high-bred air of honesty
which you can assume better than any one I ever met.
That kind of thing was bound to appeal to the old man
because he’s such an unmitigated rogue himself. Yes,
my dear boy, you’ve played your cards well, and I
congratulate you.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea what you are driving at,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me you don’t know what is in
this letter?”</p>

<p>“The letter was delivered to me sealed, and I have
delivered it sealed to you. I have no more notion what
it contains than you had before I handed it to you.”</p>

<p>“Is that really a fact? Well, Tremorne, you’re a
constant puzzle and delight to me. This world would
be a less interesting place if you were out of it. It is
an ever-recurring problem to me whether you’re deep
or shallow; but if you are shallow I’ll say this, that it
cuts more ice than depth would do. Well, just cast
your eyes over the last paragraph in that letter.” He
tossed across the final sheet to me, and I read as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The condition under which I shall treat with you is this:
You will place at once in the Bank of Japan, to the order of
Rupert Tremorne, the five hundred thousand dollars you borrowed
from him, together with interest compounded for three
years at six per cent. If, as is likely, you are not in a position to
hand over such a sum, you may pay half the amount into the
Bank of Japan here, and cable to have the other half similarly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
placed in the First National Bank of Chicago. The moment
I receive cable advice from my confidential man of business in
Chicago that the money is in the bank there, or the moment
you show me the whole amount is in the bank here, I shall
carry out the promises I have made in the body of this letter.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l6">“Yours truly,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Silas K. Hemster</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>The look of astonishment that doubtless came into
my face must have appeared genuine to Cammerford as
he watched me keenly across the table. I handed the
letter back to him.</p>

<p>“I assure you I know nothing of this proviso.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Cammerford airily, “I hope
you will have no objection to paying me back the
money when once you have received it. I trust that
your silk-stockinged idea of strict honesty will impel
you toward the course I have suggested.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Cammerford,
but circumstances have changed since I saw you
last, and, if you don’t mind, I’ll keep the money.”</p>

<p>Cammerford laughed heartily; he was in riotous
good humour, and I suppose his compensation in this
trust-forming business would be so enormous that the
amount paid into the bank seemed trifling by comparison.</p>

<p>“I should be glad,” said I, rising, “if you would
pen a few words to Mr. Hemster accepting or declining
his offer.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will, dear boy,” he replied, taking the
latest pattern of fountain pen from his waistcoat pocket;
“you are the most courteous of messengers, and I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
not keep you two shakes.” Whereupon he rapidly
scrawled a note, blotted it, sealed it, and handed it
to me.</p>

<p>He arose and accompanied me to the door, placing
me under some temporary inconvenience by slapping
me boisterously on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Tremorne, old man, you’re a brick, and a right-down
deep one after all. I’m ever so much obliged
to you for lending me your money, although I did not
think it would be recalled so soon, and I did not expect
the interest to be so heavy. Still, I needed it at the
time, and put it where it has done the most good. So
long, old fellow. You will imagine yourself a rich
man to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I imagine myself a rich man to-day, Mr. Cammerford.”</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">On</span> reaching the yacht I went directly to the old
gentleman’s office and handed him Cammerford’s
letter, which he tore open, read,
and tossed on the desk.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemster,” said I, while an emotion which I
had not suspected myself of possessing caused my
voice to tremble a little; “Mr. Hemster, I don’t know
how I can thank you for what you have done for me
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right, that’s all right!” he said
gruffly, as if the reference annoyed him. “What you
need is a guardian.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said I, “I have secured one.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman glanced up at me quickly.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well, if the land lays as I have suspected,
I congratulate you. Yes, and I congratulate
Hilda also. As for a guardian, you have chosen a good
one, and now don’t begin to thank me over again, but
go and tell her all about it.”</p>

<p>Thus dismissed, I went to the saloon, and there
found the lady of whom I was in search, and persuaded
her to come up on deck with me. In spite of
the vexatious interruption to which we had been forced
to submit at this spot, I had become attached to the
locality of the two chairs and the wicker table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>“I like this place,” said I, “for its associations, and
yet I am certain, the moment we begin to talk, Mr.
Hemster will order me overboard, or his daughter will
tell you to go down below.”</p>

<p>“There is no immediate danger,” answered Hilda.
“Mr. Hemster is busy, and his daughter has not returned
from Nagasaki; I suspect, however, that you
should be down in the office helping your chief, rather
than up here frivolously gossiping with me.”</p>

<p>“I am obeying orders in being up here. My chief,
as you call him, told me to search you out and tell you
all about it.”</p>

<p>“All about what?”</p>

<p>“Did you tell Mr. Hemster anything of our conversation
after I left?”</p>

<p>“Not a word. Poor dear, his mind was occupied
with other matters. He talked about you, and fished,&mdash;in,
oh, such an awkward way,&mdash;to find out what I
thought of you. He gave me much good counsel
which I shall ever treasure, and he warned me to beware
of fascinating young men, and not allow myself
to become too deeply interested. Indeed I yearned to
let him know that his caution was already too late;
but, not being sure whether that would ease his mind
or cause it greater anxiety, I held my peace. I wish
you would tell him. Perhaps I should do it myself,
but I cannot find the exact words, I am afraid.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him with great pleasure. No, to be honest,
I have already told him.”</p>

<p>“Really, and what did he say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he said I needed a guardian, and I informed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
him I had already secured one. He twigged the situation
in a moment, congratulated me on my choice, and
ordered me to come and tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about what? I’ve asked you that before.”</p>

<p>“Why, about the money with which we are to start
housekeeping. Mr. Hemster estimates that it will
amount to something more than half a million.”</p>

<p>Hilda sat back in her chair with a remote resemblance
to a frown on her pretty brow.</p>

<p>“That was what you were discussing with Mr.
Hemster, was it?” she said primly.</p>

<p>“Of course. Don’t you think it most important?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is.”</p>

<p>“He certainly thought so, and looked on me as very
fortunate coming into such a tidy sum so easily.”</p>

<p>“Easily! Did he, indeed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s awfully pleased about it, and so am I.”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear it.”</p>

<p>“He said you would be, and he regards me as more
than lucky, which, to tell the truth, I acknowledge that
I am. You see it was such a complete surprise. I
hadn’t expected anything at all, and to find myself
suddenly the possessor of such a sum, all because of a
few words, seemed almost too good to be true.”</p>

<p>Hilda was leaning back in her chair; there was no
question about the frown now, which was visible
enough, and, as I prattled on, the displeasure in her
speaking eyes became deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>“All because of a few words!” she murmured, as if
talking to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly. Plain, simple, straightforward words,
yet look what an effect they had. They practically
make me an independent man, even rich, as I should
count riches, although I suppose Mr. Hemster
wouldn’t consider the amount very important.”</p>

<p>“Probably not, but you seem to look upon the
amount as very, very important,&mdash;even of paramount
importance, I should say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not of paramount importance, of course, but
nevertheless I shall always regard this day as the most
fortunate of my life.”</p>

<p>“Really? Because of the money, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Now, Hilda,” I protested, “you must admit that
money is exceedingly necessary.”</p>

<p>“I do admit it. So Mr. Hemster was more pleased
about your getting the money than anything else?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t say that, but he certainly was delighted
with my luck, and what true friend wouldn’t
be? I am sure my people at home will be overjoyed
when they hear the news.”</p>

<p>“Because of the money?” reiterated Hilda, with
more of irritation in her tone than I had ever heard
there before.</p>

<p>“Why not? Such a lump of gold is not won every
day.”</p>

<p>“By a few simple words,” suggested Hilda tartly.</p>

<p>“Exactly. If you choose the psychological moment
and use the right words they form a great combination,
I can tell you, and success is sure to follow.”</p>

<p>“Deserving man! I think those that called you a
fool were mistaken, don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I rather imagine they are, and in fact that has
been admitted.”</p>

<p>“So you and Mr. Hemster have been discussing
this money question down in your office?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at first, of course. I began about the money
at once, and thanked him sincerely for what he had
done.”</p>

<p>“You were quite right; if it had not been for him
there would have been no money to make you so jubilant.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I told him. ‘Mr. Hemster’
said I, ‘if it had not been for your action I should never
have got a penny.’”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hilda, with a little break in her voice
that went right to my heart and made me ashamed of
myself, while the moisture gathered in her eyes, “and
so you and Mr. Hemster at last got to me, and began
to discuss me after the money question had been exhausted.
Really, I suppose I should be thankful to
have received so much attention. I wish I had known
that gold occupied so large a space in your thoughts,
and then I should have entered more accurately into
particulars. I told you the amount was two or three
times the face value of the stock, but it is what you say,
over half a million, and now if you don’t mind I shall
go downstairs for a while.”</p>

<p>“I do mind. I want to speak to you, Hilda.”</p>

<p>“I would rather not talk any more just now. If you
are wise you will say nothing until I have had time to
think it all over.”</p>

<p>“But I never claimed to be wise, Hilda. Sit down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
again, I beg of you. Indeed you must, I shall not let
you go at this juncture.”</p>

<p>The flash in her eyes chased away the mist that had
veiled them.</p>

<p>“Sir,” she cried, “you are only making matters
worse. If you have any care for me, say no more
until I see you again.”</p>

<p>“Hilda,” said I, “I can make it all right with you
in five minutes. What will you bet?”</p>

<p>“If you are jesting, I am tired of it. Can’t you see
I don’t want to talk. Don’t you understand you have
said enough? Do be content. I wish I hadn’t a
penny of money, and that I had never told you.”</p>

<p>I now became aware that I was on the horns of a
dilemma; I had gone too far, as a stupid man will who
thinks he is on the track of a joke. The dear girl was
on the verge of tears, and I saw that if I suddenly proclaimed
the jest her sorrow would turn into anger
against me, and my last state might be worse than my
first. I had got this joke by the tail, and the whole
dilemma arose through not knowing whether it was
safer to hang on or let go. I quickly decided to hang
on. I trusted to escape by reason of our national reputation
for unreadiness, and determined to stand to my
guns and proclaim that all along I had been speaking
of my own fortune and not of hers. My obtuseness
she would pity and forgive, but ill-timed levity and
trifling with her most cherished feelings on this day
of all others might produce consequences I dared not
face.</p>

<p>“Hilda,” I said, with what dignity I could bring to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
my command, “you actually seem sorry at my good
fortune. I assure you I expected you would rejoice
with me. When I spoke to you this morning I was to
all intents and purposes a penniless man, and yet, as
Mr. Hemster himself informed you, I had but an hour
before refused two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
as a bribe. That money was but half of the fortune
which this man Cammerford had previously looted
from me. Now, through a few simple words in the
letter Mr. Hemster wrote to him, this man is going to
refund the whole half million, with interest for three
years at six per cent. Therefore, my darling, imagine
the delight with which I learned of this great stroke
of good luck. No living person could assert here or
hereafter that I was an impecunious fortune-hunter,
although equally, of course, no person could have convinced
you that your money weighed a particle with
me when I asked you to honour me as you have done.
And now, really perhaps I am too sensitive, but it seems
to me that you do not take the news so kindly as I had
expected.”</p>

<p>She swayed a moment, then sank helplessly down
into the armchair again.</p>

<p>“Rupert,” she said, looking across at me with a
puzzled pathos in her eyes that made me ashamed of
myself; “Rupert, what are you talking about? Or
am I dreaming? What half million is this you are
referring to? I told you that my fortune was two or
three times the hundred thousand, but I supposed you
had found out its real value. Now you seem to have
been speaking of something else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>“Hilda,” I cried, with a horror that I hope was well
simulated,&mdash;Lord forgive me for the necessity of
using it,&mdash;“Hilda, you never supposed for a moment
that I was referring to <em>your</em> money?”</p>

<p>Her troubled face seemed fixed on something intangible
in the distance, as if her mind were trying
to recall our conversation, that she might find some
point in what I had said to account for the mistake she
supposed herself to have made. The double meaning
of my words was apparent enough, but of course every
sentence I had uttered applied to her money equally
well with my own. Now that enlightenment had come,
her supposed error became obtrusively plain to her.
She turned her puzzled face to me, and her expression
melted into one of great tenderness as she reached forward
her two hands and laid her palms on the back of
mine, which rested on the wicker table.</p>

<p>“Rupert,” she said in a low voice, “will you forgive
me? I have deeply misjudged you.”</p>

<p>“Hilda,” said I, “would you have forgiven me if I
had been in the wrong?”</p>

<p>“I would, I would, I would,” she cried, and it was
plain that she meant it, yet I did not dare to risk a full
confession. What brutes we men are after all, and
how much we stand in need of forgiveness every day
of our lives!</p>

<p>“Tell me all about this newly found treasure,” she
said, and now I launched out on fresh ground once
more, resolving never to get on such thin ice again
after so narrow an escape. As we talked, the indefatigable
little naphtha launch came alongside, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Gertrude Hemster appeared at the gangway, followed
by her miniature Countess. Miss Hemster was good
enough to ignore us entirely, and, after a few words to
her new companion, disappeared down the companion-way.
The Countess toddled up to where we sat, and,
addressing Hilda, said in her high-keyed Japanese
voice:</p>

<p>“Mees Stretton, the mistress desires your attendance
immediately,” and with that she toddled away again.
Hilda rose at once.</p>

<p>“Don’t go,” I commanded; but she smiled, and held
out her hand to me.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny,” she said; “you and I together
are equal to one millionaire, yet we have to dance attendance
when called upon, but, unlike others in bondage,
we don’t need to cry, ‘How long, O Lord! how
long?’ do we?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life, Hilda, as they say in the Wild
West. The day of jubilee is a-coming my dear,” and,
in spite of her trying to slip away, I put my arm around
her and drew her toward me.</p>

<p>“Oh, the captain is looking at us,” she whispered
in alarm.</p>

<p>“The captain is a good friend of ours, and has done
the same in his time, I dare say,” and with that I&mdash;&mdash;.
Hilda swung herself free and fled, red as a rose. On
glancing up at the bridge I noticed that the captain
had suddenly turned his back on us. I always did like
that rough man from Cape Cod, who would haunt the
bridge during his waking hours whether the ship had
steam up or not.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Next</span> day was the most eventful I had spent
on the yacht in spite of all that had gone
before, for a few moments were filled with
a peril which we escaped, as one might say, by a
miracle, or more accurately by the prompt and energetic
action of a capable man whom I shall always regard
with deep affection. If Cape Cod has turned out
many like him, it is a notable section of a great
country.</p>

<p>Somewhat early in the morning I paid my third visit
to the Nagasaki Hotel and brought John C. Cammerford
with me to the yacht. He told me he had placed
the full amount to my credit in the Bank of Japan, and
said he did not need to do any cabling to America. Mr.
Hemster was closeted with him in his office until the
luncheon gong rang, and the amiable Cammerford was
a guest at our table, referring to me several times as his
old friend, and recounting stories that were more humourous
than accurate about my adventures with him
in the Adirondack Mountains and the fishing districts
of Canada. I gathered that all the stories he had ever
heard of Englishmen he now fastened on me, relating
them with great gusto as having come within his own
cognizance. Therefore I was delighted to be able to
inform him that one of his anecdotes had appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
<cite>Punch</cite> in the year 1854, which he promptly denied,
whereupon I proposed a modest little wager that was
accepted by him under the supposition that I could not
prove my assertion. But we happened to have in the
library two volumes of <cite>Punch</cite> for that year, which I
had frequently thumbed over, and I now confounded
him by their production. I don’t think he minded the
money so much as the slight cast on what he supposed
to be a genuine American joke. About three o’clock
the good man left us in a high state of exultation, carried
away by the useful naphtha launch.</p>

<p>We were all on deck about four o’clock in the afternoon
when the event happened to which I have referred.
Hilda and I were sitting in our chairs by the
wicker table, quite boldly in the face of all, for our
engagement was now public property. Gertrude Hemster
and the little Japanese noblewoman were walking
up and down the other side of the deck, and from the
snatches of conversation wafted to us it really seemed
as if Miss Hemster were learning Japanese. She had
passed the ignoring phase so far as I was concerned,
and had reached the stage of the icily polite and
scrupulously courteous high dame, so that I quite looked
forward to an intimate interview with her later on if
this change continued. The old gentleman occupied
his customary armchair with his feet on the rail, and
it is a marvellous thing to record that during all the
excitement he never shifted his position. He said
afterward that it was the captain’s duty to deal with
the crisis, and he had absolute confidence in the captain.
This confidence was not misplaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span></p>

<p>The harbor of Nagasaki is usually crowded with
shipping, and steamers are continually arriving or departing,
consequently they attract but little attention,
for they are generally capably managed. Of course
a yacht swinging at anchor with no steam up is absolutely
helpless if some vessel under way bears down
upon her. We were lying broadside on to Nagasaki.
I was so absorbed in my conversation with Hilda that
I did not notice our danger until the captain put
a megaphone to his lips and vehemently hailed an oncoming
steamer. Looking up, I saw a huge, black,
clumsy craft steaming right down upon us, and knew
in a moment that if she did not deflect her course she
would cut us in two amidships. The captain, who
recognized the nationality of the vessel, although I did
not, roared down to me:</p>

<p>“What is the Chinese for ‘Sheer off?’”</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet. “Fling me the megaphone,”
I cried. He instantly heaved it down to me, and a
moment later I was roaring through it a warning to
the approaching steamer. But to this not the slightest
attention was paid, nor indeed could I see anyone
aboard. The black brute came on as if she were an
abandoned ship without captain or crew. She appeared
to grow up out of the waters; looming tremendous in
size above us, and it did seem as if nothing under Heaven
could save us. However, good luck and the resources
of our captain did that very thing. The good
luck assumed the shape of a tug which came tearing
past our stern. The captain by this time was on deck
with a coil of rope with a bowline on its end. Not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
word did he say to the flying tug, but he swung the rope
so unerringly that the loop came down like a flying
quoit right on the sternpost of the little vessel. In a
flash the captain had the end he held twisted twice
around a huge iron cleat at our side.</p>

<div id="if_p250" class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
  <img src="images/p250.jpg" width="364" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>“I sprang forward and caught her.”</p></div>
  <div class="captionr"><a href="#Page_251"><i>Page 251</i></a>
</div></div>

<p>“Lie down, you women, at once,” he roared, bracing
his feet against the cleat and hanging back upon the
end of the rope.</p>

<p>Hilda obeyed instantly, but Miss Hemster, with the
Countess clinging to her, stood dazed, while I sprang
forward and caught her, breaking the fall as much as
was possible, all three of us coming down in a heap
with myself underneath. The rope had tightened like
a rod, and had either to break, jerk the tug backward
out of the water, or swing us around, which latter it
did, taking the yacht from under us with a suddenness
that instantly overcame all equilibrium, and in a jiffy
we were at right angles to our former position, while
the black hulk scraped harmlessly along our side.
Even now no one appeared on the deck of the Chinese
steamer, but after running a hundred yards nearer the
city she slowly swerved around, heading outward
again, and I thought she was about to escape; but instead
of that she came to a standstill a quarter of a
mile or so from our position and there coolly dropped
anchor.</p>

<p>I helped the ladies to their feet again, inquiring if
they were hurt, and Miss Hemster replied with a sweet
smile that, thanks to me, she was not. The Countess
showed signs of hysterics with which I could not deal,
therefore I turned my attention to Hilda, who by this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
time had scrambled up, looking rather pale and frightened.
Mr. Hemster’s chair had been swung with a
crash against the bulwarks, and he had been compelled
to take his feet down from the rail, but beyond that he
kept his old position, chewing industriously at his unlit
cigar. The captain was in a ludicrously pitiable position
because of a red-hot Cape Cod rage and his inability
to relieve his feelings by swearing on account
of the ladies being present. Hilda noticed this and
cried with a little quivering laugh:</p>

<p>“Don’t mind us, captain; say what you want to,
and it is quite likely we will agree with you.”</p>

<p>The captain shook his huge fist at the big steamer
now rounding to her anchorage.</p>

<p>“You can say what you please,” he shouted; “that
was no accident; it was intended. That damned,&mdash;I
beg your pardon, ladies,&mdash;that chap tried to run us
down, and I’ll have the law of him, dod-blast-him,&mdash;excuse
me, ladies,&mdash;if there’s any law in this God-forsaken
hole!”</p>

<p>Mr. Hemster very calmly shoved his chair back to
its former position, and put his feet once more on the
rail, then he beckoned to the captain, and when that
angry hero reached his side he said imperturbably, as
if nothing had happened:</p>

<p>“Captain, there’s no use swearing. Besides, so
capable a man as you never needs to swear. In that
half minute you earned ten thousand dollars, and I’ll
make it more if you don’t think it enough.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” protested the captain, “it’s all in the
day’s work: a lucky throw of the rope, that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>“Now I see that you want to swear at somebody,”
Mr. Hemster went on, “and suppressed profanity is
bad for the system; so I suppose you’ll prefer to swear
at the person mostly to blame. Get into the launch
with Mr. Tremorne here, who will translate for you,
because our oaths, unlike our gold, are not current in
every country. Go over to that black monstrosity; get
aboard of her; find out what their game is, and swear
at whoever is responsible. When we know their object
we can take action, either by law, or by hiring
some pirate to run her down and see how she likes it
herself. I want to get at the bottom of this business.”</p>

<p>The upshot was that the captain and I got into the
naphtha launch and made directly for the Chinese
steamer. We went around her twice, but saw not a
soul on board, neither was there any ladder alongside
by which we could ascend, or even a rope; so, after
calling in vain for them to throw us a line, the captain,
with an agility I should not have expected of his years
and bulk, caught hold of the anchor-chain and worked
himself up over the bow. His head appearing over
the rail must have been a stupefying surprise to the
crew, whom he found lying flat on their faces on deck.
I followed the captain up the anchor-chain route,
though in somewhat less effective fashion, until I was
at the captain’s heels. He had thrown one leg across
the rail, when he whipped out a revolver and fired two
rapid shots, which were followed by howls of terror.
The crew had sprung to their feet and flashed out
knives, but his quick revolver-shots stopped the attack
even before it was rightly begun. We both leaped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
over the rail to the deck. The cowardly crew were
huddled in a heap; no one had been killed, but two
were crippled and crawled moaning on the deck; the
rest had ceased their outcry and crouched together with
that hopeless air of resignation to take stolidly whatever
fate had in store for them, which is characteristic
of the lower-class Chinese. They expected instant
death and were prepared to meet it with nonchalance.</p>

<p>“Where is your captain?” I asked them in their
own tongue.</p>

<p>Several of them made a motion of their head toward
a low deck-house aft.</p>

<p>“Go and bring him,” I said to one who seemed
rather more intelligent than the rest. He got on his
feet and went into the deck-house, presently emerging
with a trembling man who admitted he was the captain.</p>

<p>“What did you mean,” I asked him, “by trying to
run us down?”</p>

<p>He spread out his hands with a gesture that seemed
to indicate his helplessness, and maintained that it was
all an accident.</p>

<p>“That is not true,” I insisted, but nothing could
budge him from his statement that the steering-gear
had gone wrong and he had lost control of the ship.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you stop the engines when you saw
where you were going?” I asked.</p>

<p>He had become panic-stricken, he said, and so had
the crew. The engineer had run up on deck, and there
was no one to shut off steam. I knew the man was lying,
and told our captain so, whereupon he pressed the
muzzle of his revolver against the other’s forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>“Now question him,” he said.</p>

<p>I did so, but the captain simply relapsed into the condition
of his crew, and not another word could I get
out of him.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” I said to our captain, “these people
don’t mind being shot in the least. You might massacre
the whole lot, and yet not get a word of truth out
of any one of them previous to their extinction. Nevertheless,
until you kill them they are in some wholesome
fear of firearms, so if you keep the drop on the captain
and his men I’ll penetrate this deck-house and see
what it contains.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that,” said our captain, “they’re
treacherous dogs, I imagine, and, while afraid to meet
us in broad daylight on deck here, they might prove
mighty handy with the knife in the darkness of that
shanty. No, send the captain in and order him to
bring out all his officers, if he’s got any.”</p>

<p>This seemed practical advice, so, asking our captain
to remove his revolver from the other’s forehead, I
said to the latter:</p>

<p>“How many officers have you?”</p>

<p>He answered that there were five.</p>

<p>“Very well, go and bring them all out on deck
here.”</p>

<p>He gave the order to one of the crew, who went into
the deck-house and presently came out with five discouraged-looking
Chinese ship’s officers. There was
nothing to be made out of this lot; they simply stood
in a row and glowered at us without answering.
Whenever I put a question to them they glanced at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
captain, then turned their bovine gaze upon me, but
never once did one of them open his mouth.</p>

<p>“Now, captain,” said I, “I propose that we herd this
whole mob, officers and men, into the forecastle. The
windlass, anchor-tackle, and all that will impede them,
if they endeavour to take concerted action. You stand
here on the clear deck with your two revolvers and
keep an eye on them. The captain and officers will
probably imagine you understand Chinese, too, so they
will give no orders. Then I shall penetrate into the
deck-house, for I am convinced that we have not yet
come upon the responsible man. I don’t believe this
fellow is the captain at all.”</p>

<p>To all this my comrade agreed, although he still demurred
at my entering the deck-house. I ordered the
men forward and then lined the alleged captain and
his officers along the rail near them, and, while my captain
stood by with a revolver in each hand, I, similarly
equipped, went down three steps into the low cabin.
It was a dangerous move if there had been anyone of
courage within, for there were no windows, and what
little light penetrated the place came in through the
open door, and that was now largely shut out by the
bulk of my body. Knowing that I was rather conspicuously
silhouetted against the outside glare and
formed an easy mark for either pistol or knife, I stepped
down as quickly as possible and then stood aside. I
thought at first the place was empty, but as my eyes
became accustomed to the gloom I saw that a bench
ran around three walls and in the further corner was a
huddled figure which I knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, Excellency Hun Woe!” I cried, covering him
with the revolver, “it is to you then we were to have
been indebted for our death.”</p>

<p>The wretch flung himself on his face at my feet,
moaning for mercy. A Corean never has the nonchalance
of a Chinaman when danger confronts him.</p>

<p>“Get up from the floor and sit down where you
were,” I said; “I want to have some conversation
with you.” Then I went to the door again and cried
to the captain:</p>

<p>“It’s all right. There is no one here but the Prime
Minister of Corea, and I think I begin to see daylight
so far as this so-called accident is concerned. I want
to have a few minutes’ talk with him, so, unless you
hear a pistol-shot, everything is going well.”</p>

<p>“Good enough,” cried the genial captain, “you play
a lone hand for all it’s worth, and I’ll hold up these
hoodlums while you pow-wow.”</p>

<p>“Now, Hun Woe,” I cried, turning to him, “what
is the meaning of this dastardly trick?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Excellency,” he moaned, “I am the most miserable
of men.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are. I admit that, and, furthermore, unless
you tell the truth you are in some danger of your
life at this moment.”</p>

<p>“My life,” he went on,&mdash;and I knew he spoke truly
enough,&mdash;“is already forfeited. My family and my
kinsmen are all in the hands of the Emperor. Their
heads will fall if I do not bring back the white woman
whom the Emperor has chosen for his mate.”</p>

<p>“But how in Heaven’s name would it have brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
back the white woman if you had run us down and
drowned us all?”</p>

<p>“We have expert swimmers aboard,” he said, “divers
brought for the purpose, who would have saved the
white woman, and indeed,” he added hurriedly, “would
have saved you all, but the white woman we would
have brought back with us.”</p>

<p>“What a hairbrained scheme!” I cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellency, it is not mine. I but do what I
am ordered to do. The Emperor wished to sink the
war-vessel of the American King so that he might not
invade our coasts.”</p>

<p>“Is it true that the Empress has been murdered?”</p>

<p>“Ah, not murdered, Excellency; she died of a
fever.”</p>

<p>“She looked anything but feverish when I saw her
the day before,” I insisted.</p>

<p>“We are all in God’s hands,” said the Prime Minister
with a shrug of resignation, “and death sometimes
comes suddenly.”</p>

<p>“It does indeed in Seoul,” I commented, whereupon
the Prime Minister groaned aloud, thinking probably
of his own impending fate and that of his wife, children,
and kinsfolk.</p>

<p>“Excellency,” he went on with the courage of desperation,
“it is all your fault. If you had not brought
that creature to Seoul, I would have been a happy man
to-day. I have always been your friend, and it is said
your country stands by its friends; but that, I fear, is
not true. You can help me now, but perhaps you will
not do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>“I admit it is largely my fault, although, like yourself,
I was merely the Prime Minister on our side of
the affair. Nevertheless, if there is anything I can do
to help you, Hun Woe, I shall be very glad to do
it.”</p>

<p>He brightened up perceptibly at this, and said
eagerly, as if to give further spur to my inclination:</p>

<p>“If you do, I will make you a rich man, Excellency.”</p>

<p>Nothing showed the desperate nature of his case
more conclusively than this offer of money, which is
always a Corean’s very last card.</p>

<p>“I do not want a single sek from you, Hun Woe;
in fact I am willing to give away many thousands of
them if it will aid you. Tell me what I can do for you.
I will even go so far as to return with you to Seoul and
beg or bribe the Emperor’s clemency.”</p>

<p>“That would indeed be useless,” demurred the
Prime Minister; “His Majesty would promise you anything
and take what money you liked to give him; but
my body would be dismembered as soon as you were
gone, and all my kinsfolk killed or sent to slavery.”</p>

<p>I knew this to be an accurate presentation of the
case.</p>

<p>“What, then, can I do for you?” I asked.</p>

<p>He lowered his voice, his little eyes glittering.</p>

<p>“There is but one thing to do, and that is to get the
white woman on board this ship.”</p>

<p>“To kidnap her? That is impossible; you cannot
do it here in Japan, and you could not do it even if
the ship were lying in Chemulpo roadstead. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
dream of foolishness, and if your Emperor had any
sense he would know it could not be done.”</p>

<p>“Then,” wailed Hun Woe, “my line is extinguished,
and the deaths of myself and of my relatives lie at your
door, who brought the accursed white woman to
Seoul.”</p>

<p>His lamentations disturbed me deeply, because, for a
wonder, he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I will do, Hun Woe, which will
be far more effective than your ridiculous project of
kidnapping the young lady. Has not your Emperor
the sense to see, or have you not the courage to tell him,
that if you succeeded in getting Miss Hemster to Seoul
you would bring down on yourselves the whole force
of America, and probably of England as well? Either
country could blot Seoul, Palace and all, off the face
of the earth within half an hour of surrounding it, and
they would do it, too, if needs be. You know I speak
the truth; why did you not explain this to the Emperor?”</p>

<p>“His Majesty would not believe me; his Majesty
cares for nothing but the white woman; so any other
plan but that of getting her is useless.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t. So far as you are concerned, Hun
Woe, it would be useless for me to appeal to either the
English or the American authorities. They will never
interfere unless one of their own citizens is in jeopardy,
but I can trust the Japanese. I am sure Mr. Hemster
will lend me his yacht, and I will take a party of fearless
Japanese with me to the capital and to the Palace.
There will be no trouble. I shall return with your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
family and your kinsmen, escort them down to Chemulpo,
and I shall deliver them to you here in Nagasaki.
So long as you remain in Nagasaki you are
safe.”</p>

<p>This brave offer brought no consolation to the Prime
Minister of Corea: he shook his head dolefully, and
told me what I already knew, that a man who fled from
Corea to Nagasaki had been nearly murdered here by
Coreans, then, thinking himself more safe under the
British flag, he had escaped to Shanghai, where he was
followed and killed in cold blood, his mutilated remains
being taken to Seoul, and there exhibited. All his
relatives and his family had already preceded him into
the unknown.</p>

<p>“Nothing will suffice,” groaned the Prime Minister,
“but the white woman,&mdash;may curses alight on her
head!”</p>

<p>“Do not be so downhearted; my scheme is quite
practicable, while yours is not. Mr. Hemster is the
most generous of men, and I am certain he will see you
and your family safe across the Pacific to the United
States, and there I will guarantee no Corean will ever
follow you. You have money enough if you can get
your hands on it. Perhaps you have some here with
you now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied simply, “I have my whole fortune
on board this ship.”</p>

<p>“There you are. I see you did not intend to return
to Corea if you could not get the white woman.”</p>

<p>“It was not that. I brought my fortune to give it
away in bribes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>“And that’s why you offered me a bribe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellency,” he replied with childlike candour.</p>

<p>“Well, Hun Woe, take my advice. I think I shall
be able to get you all clear away. You are in command
here, and these Chinese would rather die than
split on you, so perhaps, instead of taking Mr. Hemster’s
yacht, we had better stick to this vessel, and I
will bring my band of Japanese aboard. However,
keep up your courage until I have seen Mr. Hemster,
and then I will let you know what I am prepared to
do. As this ship is now empty you had better spend
your time and money in Nagasaki filling her with coal.
We will go to Corea, get your family and relatives
aboard, and then you can sail direct for San Francisco.
It is a wild project, but with a little courage I make
no doubt it can be carried out, and if you haven’t
money enough I can help you. Indeed, now that I
have considered the matter, I shall not ask Mr. Hemster
for his yacht at all. This ship is the very thing.
All you need is plenty of coal and plenty of provisions,
and these you can get at Nagasaki without attracting
the least attention. Mr. Hemster could not accommodate
you all on his yacht even if he consented to do so.
Yes, cheer up, my plan is quite feasible, while yours is
impossible of execution. You can no more get the
girl than you can get the moon for the Emperor of
Corea.”</p>

<p>So, telling the Prime Minister that I would call upon
him next day and discuss particulars, I left him there,
asked the captain to release the patient crew and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
officers, threw a rope ladder down the side, and so
descended to our waiting naphtha launch, the crew
of which had been rather anxious at the long silence
following the two rapid shots; but they had obeyed
orders and stood by without attempting to board.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Silas</span> Hemster was sitting in his wicker
chair on deck just as I had left him, so I drew
up another chair beside him and sat down to
give him my report. He listened to the end without
comment.</p>

<p>“What a darned-fool scheme,” he said at last. “There
wasn’t one chance in a thousand of those chumps picking
any of us out alive if they had once destroyed the
yacht. Do you think they will attempt it again?”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems as if I had discouraged old Hun
Woe, but a person never can tell how the Oriental
mind works. He stated that the precious plan emanated
from the Emperor, who wished at a blow to destroy
your fleet, as it were, and capture your daughter;
but it is more than likely the scheme was concocted in
his own brain. He is just silly enough to have contrived
it, but I rather imagine our good captain overawed
the officers and crew to such an extent that they
may be chary of attempting such an outrage again.
When two of us had no difficulty in holding up the
whole company, they may fear an attack from our entire
crew. Still, as I have said, no one can tell what
these people will do or not do. The Prime Minister
himself, of course, is in a bad way, and I should like
to enable him to escape if I could.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>“You intend, then, to carry out the project you outlined
to him?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do, with your permission.”</p>

<p>“Well, not to flatter you, Tremorne, I think your
invasion of Corea at the head of a band of Japanese is
quite as foolhardy as his attempt to run down the
yacht.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Mr. Hemster; the Coreans are a bad people
to run away from, but if you face them boldly you
get what you want. They call it the Hermit Kingdom,
but I should call it the Coward Kingdom. A
squad of determined little Japs would put the whole
country to flight.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can do as you like, and I’ll help you all
I’m able. Of course you’re not responsible for the
plight of the Prime Minister; I’m the cause of the
mix-up, and if you want the yacht you just take it, and
I’ll stay here in Nagasaki with the womenfolk till you
return; but if I had my way I’d clear out of this section
of the country altogether.”</p>

<p>“Why not do so, Mr. Hemster. I have entirely
given up the notion of taking the yacht, because the
Chinese steamer will be much less conspicuous and will
cause less talk in Chemulpo than the coming back of
the yacht. Of course the Emperor will have spies
down at the port, and it will seem to them perfectly
natural for the black ship to return. Meanwhile, before
his Majesty knows what has happened, I shall be
up in Seoul and in the Palace with my Japanese, and
I think I shall succeed in terrorizing the old boy to such
an extent that in less than ten minutes we shall be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
marching back again with Hun Woe’s whole family
and troop of relatives. ‘Once aboard the lugger’ they
are safe, for Corea has no ship to overtake them, and
the whole thing will be done so suddenly that the Chinese
steamer will be half-way across the Pacific, or the
whole way to Shanghai, before the Coreans have made
up their minds what to do. I shall leave with the
ship, and have them drop me at Nagasaki or Shanghai,
or whatever port we conclude to make for. Then I
can rejoin the yacht at any port we agree upon.”</p>

<p>“You appear to think you’ll have no trouble with
your expedition, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not the slightest.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, we had trouble enough with
ours.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but this is a mere dash of twenty-six miles
there and twenty-six miles back. We ought to be able
to do it within a day and a night, and if old Hun Woe
attends rightly to his coaling and his provisioning, all
Corea cannot stop him. I think he is badly enough
frightened not to omit any details that make for his
safety.”</p>

<p>“Very well, we’ll stay right here till you return. I
suppose that old Chinese tub will take some time worrying
her way to Corea and back again, although I’ll
confess she seemed to come on like a prairie fire when
she was heading for us. Now I guess everybody is
just a little tired of life on shipboard. I’ve noticed
that when a lot of people are cooped up together for a
while things don’t run on as smoothly as they might
sometimes, so I’ll hire a floor in the principal hotel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
here and live ashore until we see your Chinese steamer
come into the harbour again. I suppose the captain will
prefer to live on the yacht, but the rest of us will sample
hotel life. I’m rather yearning for a change myself;
besides I think my daughter would be safer ashore
than on board here, for one can’t tell, as you said, what
these hoodlums may attempt; and as long as they’re
convinced she’s on the yacht we’re in constant danger
of being run down, or torpedoed, or something. Now,
you wouldn’t mind telling my daughter what you’ve
told me about the intentions of this here Prime Minister?
She’s rather fond of wandering around town
alone, and I guess she’d better know that until this
Chinese steamer sails away she is in some danger.”</p>

<p>“I suggest that she shouldn’t go sightseeing or
shopping without an escort, Mr. Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Well, a good deal will depend on what Gertie
thinks herself, as perhaps you have found out while
you’ve been with us.”</p>

<p>He sent for his daughter, and I placed a third chair
for the girl when she arrived. She listened with great
interest to my narration of the events on board the
Chinese steamer, and I added my warning that it was
advisable for her not to desert the frequented parts of
Nagasaki, and never to make any expedition through
the town without one or more masculine persons to
protect her. She tossed her head as I said this, and
replied rather cuttingly:</p>

<p>“I guess I’m able to take care of myself.”</p>

<p>I should have had sense enough to let it go at that,
but I was much better aware of her peril then even her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
father was, for I knew Nagasaki like a well-thumbed
book; so I said it was a regular labyrinth into whose
mazes even a person intimately acquainted with the
town might get lost, and as the Prime Minister had
plenty of money at his command, he had the choice of
all the outscourings of the nations here along the port,
who would murder or kidnap without a qualm for a
very small sum of ready cash.</p>

<p>“There is no use in saying anything more, Mr. Tremorne,”
put in her father, definitely; “I’ll see to it
that my daughter does not go abroad unprotected.”</p>

<p>“Well, Poppa,” she cried, “I like the hotel idea first
rate, and I’m going there right away; but I want a
suite of rooms to myself. I’m not coming down to the
public table, and I wish to have the Countess and my
own maid with me and no one else.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said her father, “you can have
what you like. I’ll buy the whole hotel for you if you
want it.”</p>

<p>“No, I just wish a suite of rooms that will be my
own; and I won’t have any visitors that I don’t invite
specially.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you allow me to visit you, Gertie?” asked
the old gentleman with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want you or any one else. I’m just
tired of people, that’s what I am. I intended to propose
going to the hotel anyhow. I’m just sick of this
yacht, and have a notion to go home in one of the regular
steamers. I’m going right over to the hotel now
and pick my own rooms.”</p>

<p>“Just as you please,” concurred her father. “Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Mr. Tremorne will be good enough to escort you
there.”</p>

<p>“I have told you that I don’t want Mr. Tremorne,
or Mr. Hemster, or Mr. Anybody-else. If I must have
an escort I’ll take two of the sailors.”</p>

<p>“That will be perfectly satisfactory. Take as many
trunks as you want, and secure the best rooms in the
hotel.”</p>

<p>Shortly afterward Miss Hemster, with her maid
and the Countess, left the yacht in the launch, the
mountain of luggage following in another boat. The
launch and the boat remained an unconscionably long
time at the landing, until even Mr. Hemster became
impatient, ordering the captain to signal their return.
When, in response to this, they came back, the officer
in charge of the launch told Mr. Hemster that his
daughter had ordered them to remain until she sent
them word whether or not she had secured rooms to
her satisfaction at the hotel. Meanwhile she had given
the officer a letter to her father, which he now handed
to the old gentleman. He read it through two or three
times with a puzzled expression on his face, then
handed it to me, saying:</p>

<p>“What do you make of that?”</p>

<p>The letter ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Poppa</span>:
</p>

<p><span class="in4">“I</span> have changed my mind about the hotel, and, not
wanting a fuss, said nothing to you before I left. As I told
you, I am tired to death of both the yacht and the sea, and I
want to get to some place where I need look on neither of
them. The Countess, who knows more about Japan than Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Tremorne thinks he knows, has been kind enough to offer me
her country house for a week or two, which is situated eight
or nine miles from Nagasaki. I want to see something of high
life in Japan, and so may stay perhaps for two weeks; and if
you are really as anxious about my kidnapping as you pretend,
you may be quite sure I am safe where I am going,&mdash;much
more so than if I had stayed at the hotel at Nagasaki. I don’t
believe there’s any danger at all, but think Mr. Tremorne
wants to impress you with a feeling of his great usefulness,
and you may tell him I said so if you like. Perhaps I shall tire
of the place where I am going in two or three days; it is more
than likely. Anyhow, I want to get away from present company
for a time at least. I will send a message to you when I
am returning.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l6">“Yours affectionately,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Gertie</span>.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>This struck me as a most ungracious and heartless
communication to a father who was devoting his life
and fortune to her service. I glanced up at the old
gentleman; but, although he had asked my opinion on
this epistle, his face showed no perturbation regarding
its contents. I suppose he was accustomed to the
young woman’s vagaries.</p>

<p>The letter seemed to me very disquieting. It had
been written on board the yacht before she left, so
perhaps the country house visit had been in her mind
for some time; nevertheless there were two or three
circumstances which seemed to me suspicious. It was
an extraordinary thing that a Countess should take
what was practically a servant’s position if she possessed
a country house. Then, again, it was no less
extraordinary that this Japanese woman should be able
to speak Corean, of which fact I had had auricular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
demonstration. Could it be possible that there was
any connection between the engaging of this woman
and the arrival of the Chinese steamer? Was the so-called
Countess an emissary of the Corean Prime Minister?
A moment’s reflection caused me to dismiss
this conjecture as impossible, because Miss Hemster
had engaged the Countess on the day she arrived at
Nagasaki, and, as our yacht was more speedy than any
other vessel that might have come from Corea, all idea
of collusion between the Corean man and the Japanese
woman seemed far fetched. Should I then communicate
my doubts to Mr. Hemster? He seemed quite at
his ease about the matter, and I did not wish to disturb
him unnecessarily. Yet he had handed me the letter,
and he wished my opinion on it. He interrupted my
meditations by repeating his question:</p>

<p>“Well, what do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me the letter of one who is accustomed
to think and act for herself, without any undue regard
to the convenience of others.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s about the size of it.”</p>

<p>“Has she ever done anything like this before?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bless you, often. I have known her to leave
Chicago for New York and turn up at Omaha.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not in any way alarmed by the receipt
of this?”</p>

<p>“No, I see no reason for alarm; do you?”</p>

<p>“Who is this Countess that owns the country
house?”</p>

<p>“I don’t even know her name. Gertie went ashore
soon after we came into the harbour and visited the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
American Consul, who sent out for this woman, and
Gertie engaged her then and there.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a little remarkable that she speaks
Corean?”</p>

<p>“Well, the American Consul said there wasn’t many
of them could; but Gertie, after being at Seoul, determined
to learn the language, and that’s why she
took on the Countess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. She stipulated, then, for one who knew
Corean?”</p>

<p>“Quite so; she told me before we left Chemulpo
that she intended to learn the language.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Hemster, what you say relieves my mind
a good deal. If she got the woman on the recommendation
of the American Consul, everything is all right.
The coming of the Prime Minister, and the fact that
this Countess understands Corean, made me fear that
there might be some collusion between the two.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible,” said Mr. Hemster calmly.
“If the Corean Minister had come a day or two before
the Countess was engaged, there might have been
a possibility of a conspiracy between them; but convincing
proof that such is not the case lies in the fact
that the Prime Minister would not then have needed
to run us down, which he certainly tried to do.”</p>

<p>I had not thought of this, and it was quite convincing,
taken in the light of the fact that Miss Hemster
had frequently acted in this impulsive way before.</p>

<p>We resolved not to leave the yacht that night, even
if we left it at all, now that Miss Hemster had taken
herself into the interior. Whatever she thought, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
whatever her preferences were, I imagine her father
liked the yacht better than a hotel.</p>

<p>Hilda and I went on deck after dinner and remained
there while the lights came out all over Nagasaki, forming
a picture like fairyland or the superb setting of a
gigantic opera. We were aroused by a cry from one
of the sailors, and then a shout from the bridge.</p>

<p>“That Chinese beast is coming at us again!”</p>

<p>Sure enough the steamer had left her moorings,
rounded inside toward the city, and now was making
directly toward us without a light showing.</p>

<p>“Get into the boats at once,” roared the captain.</p>

<p>I hailed Hemster, who was below, at the top of my
voice, and he replied when I shouted: “Come up immediately
and get into the small boat.”</p>

<p>By the time he was on deck I had Hilda in one of the
boats, and Mr. Hemster was beside her a moment later.
Two sailors seized the oars and pushed off. The next
instant there was a crash, and the huge black bulk of
the Chinese steamer loomed over us, passing quickly
away into the night. I thought I heard a woman
scream somewhere, but could not be quite sure.</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything?” I asked Hemster.</p>

<p>“I heard an almighty crashing of timber. I wonder
if they’ve sunk the yacht.”</p>

<p>The captain’s gruff voice hailed us.</p>

<p>“They’ve carried away the rudder,” he said, “and
shattered the stern, but not seriously. She will remain
afloat, but will have to go into dry-dock to-morrow.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> Chinese steamer, if indeed it were she, although
we could not be sure in the darkness,
had sent us to the hotel when we had
made up our minds not to go. We in the boat hovered
near the yacht long enough for the captain to make a
hurried examination of the damage. The wreck certainly
looked serious, for the overhang of the stern had
been smashed into matchwood, while the derelict rudder
hung in chains like an executed pirate of a couple
of centuries agone. It was impossible at the moment
to estimate with any degree of accuracy the extent of
the disaster. The captain reported that she was not
leaking, and therefore her owner need have no fear
that she would sink during the night. The rudder
had certainly been carried away, and probably one of
the propellers was damaged. In any case the yacht
would have to go into dry-dock; so, being satisfied on
the score of immediate safety, Mr. Hemster gave orders
to pull ashore, and thus we became guests of the
Nagasaki Hotel.</p>

<p>Next morning the Chinese steamer was nowhere in
sight, so it was reasonably certain she had been the
cause of our misfortune. The yacht rode at its anchorage,
apparently none the worse so far as could be seen
from the town. Before noon the craft was in dock,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
and we learned to our relief that her propellers were
untouched. She needed a new rudder, and the rest was
mere carpenter work which would be speedily accomplished
by the deft Japanese workmen. Mr. Hemster
had his desk removed to a room in the hotel, and business
went on as before, for there were still many details
to be settled with Mr. John C. Cammerford before he
proceeded toward San Francisco. I think we all enjoyed
the enlarged freedom of residence on shore, and
the old gentleman said that he quite understood his
daughter’s desire to get away from sight of sea or ship.
It struck me as remarkable that he was not in the
slightest degree alarmed for the safety of his daughter,
nor did he doubt for a moment her assertion that she
was going to stop at the country house of the Countess.
On the other hand I was almost convinced she had been
kidnapped, but did not venture to display my suspicions
to her father, as there seemed no useful purpose to be
served by arousing anxiety when my fears rested purely
on conjecture. Of course I consulted confidentially
with Hilda, but a curious transformation had taken
place in our several beliefs. When she spoke of the
probability of the girl’s committing suicide or doing
something desperate, I had pooh-poohed her theory.
We had each convinced the other, and I had adopted
her former view while she had adopted mine. She
had heard no scream on the night of the disaster, and
regarded it as a trick of my imagination.</p>

<p>But what made me more uneasy was the departure
of the Prime Minister. His fears for himself and
family were genuine enough, and he was not likely to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
abandon a quest merely because his first effort had
failed. It meant death to him if he returned to Seoul
without the girl, so, if he had not captured her, it
seemed incredible that he should return the same night
without a single effort to accomplish his mission. The
second,&mdash;and, as far as he knew, successful,&mdash;essay
to sink the yacht, must have been to prevent pursuit.
He was probably well aware that the yacht was the
fastest steamer in the harbour, and, if it were not disabled,
would speedily overhaul him. He also knew
that his officers and crew were no heroes, and that with
half-a-dozen energetic Japanese in addition to our own
crew we could capture his steamer on the high seas
without the slightest effort being put forth to hinder
us. He had now a clear run to Chemulpo, and, however
resolute we were, there was no possibility of our
overtaking him. I had offered him my assistance,
which he had accepted in a provisional sort of way, yet
here he had disappeared from the scene without leaving
word for me, and apparently had returned to the
land where his fate was certain if he was unsuccessful.
Of course, he might have made for Yokohama or
Shanghai, but I was convinced, after all, that he cared
more for the safety of his family than for his own, and
indeed, if he was thinking only of himself, he was as
safe in Nagasaki as elsewhere. I could therefore come
to no other conclusion than that the girl was aboard
the Chinese steamer and was now a prisoner on her
way to Seoul, but of this I could not convince Hilda
Stretton, and Mr. Hemster evidently had no misgivings
in the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>Obviously the first thing to do was to learn the antecedents
of the so-called Japanese Countess, and with
this intent I called at the American Consulate. The
official in charge received me with the gracious good-comradeship
of his nation, and replied with the utmost
frankness to my questions. He remembered Miss
Hemster’s visit of a few days before, and he assured
me that the Countess was above suspicion. As for her
knowledge of Corean, that was easily accounted for,
because her late husband had been a Japanese official
at Seoul a dozen years or so ago, and she had lived
with him in that city. Corea, indeed, had been in a
way the cause of the Countess’s financial misfortunes.
Her husband, some years before he died, had invested
largely in Corean enterprises, all of which had failed,
and so left his wife with scarcely anything to live upon
except the country house, which was so remote from
Nagasaki as to be unsalable for anything like the money
he had expended upon it. Exactly where this country
house was situated the United States Consul professed
himself ignorant, but said he would endeavour to find
out for me, and so genially asked me to take a drink
with him and call a few days later.</p>

<p>This conversation did much to dissipate my doubts.
Of course, without Mr. Hemster’s permission I could
not tell the Consul the full particulars of the case, or
even make any reference to them. So far as that courteous
official knew, I was merely making inquiries on
behalf of Mr. Hemster about the woman engaged to
be his daughter’s companion, and about the country
house which the girl had been invited to visit. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Consul assured me that everything was right and
proper, and that Miss Hemster would get a glimpse of
the inner life of the Japanese not usually unfolded to
strangers, and thus my reason was convinced, although
my instinct told me there was something unaccountable
in all this. The scream I had heard simultaneously
with the crashing of the collision might of course
have been the shrill shriek of one of the Chinese sailors,
but at the time it had sounded to me suspiciously
like the terrified exclamation of a woman. Then,
again, the action of the Prime Minister remained as
unaccountable as ever, unless my former theory proved
correct. However, I got the name of the Countess,
which none of us who remained had known before, and
I promised to return and learn the situation of the
country house. My visit, on the whole, was rather
reassuring; for, after all, there was little use in attaching
too much importance to the actions of any Corean,
even though he were Prime Minister of that country;
so the problem began to appear to be a self-conjured
one, and I gradually came to recognize that I had been
troubling myself for nothing.</p>

<p>The week that followed was one of the most delightful
in my existence. The captain was superintending
the repairs on the yacht, and the intricacies of Mr.
Hemster’s business activity were such that I could not
be of much assistance to him; so there was practically
nothing to do but to make myself agreeable to that dear
girl, Hilda, to whom I showed whatever beauties Nagasaki
possessed, and surely no one knew the town better
than I did. She took a vivid interest, not only in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
the place, but also in my own somewhat doleful experience
there in former and less happy times, not yet remote,
the recital of which experiences rendered the
present all the more glorious by contrast.</p>

<p>On our tenth day ashore Hilda told me that the old
gentleman was beginning to worry because he had
heard nothing from his daughter, and Hilda herself
expressed some uneasiness because of the long silence.
This aroused all my old doubts, and I called a second
time on the American Consul. He told me that the
information I sought had been in hand several days.
The villa was called “The House of the Million Blossoms,”
and it was situated nearly ten miles from
Nagasaki. He produced a sketch map, drawn by himself,
which he said would guide me to the place, so I
resolved to visit it without saying a word to anyone.</p>

<p>I found the villa of the Blossoms without the least
difficulty, and a most enchanting spot it appeared to be.
Situated inland, at the bottom of a sheltered valley,
through which ran a trickling stream, the place had
evidently been one of importance in its day; but now
the entrance lodge showed signs of dilapidation, and
the plantation itself was so marvellously overgrown as
to be almost a wilderness, with foliage too thick for
me to see anything of the house itself. The custodian
of the lodge received me with great urbanity but no
less firmness. He confessed that the ladies were there,
but added that he had strict orders to allow no one to
enter or even to approach the house. I asked him to
take my card to the stranger lady, and, although at
first he demurred, I overcome his reluctance by an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
urbanity which I flatter myself was a stage imitation
of his own, and, what was more to the purpose, I induced
him to accept a present in the coinage of the
realm. Nevertheless he securely barred the gate and
left me outside, showing that his trust in my good
faith was either very weak, or that his politeness was
confined to the flowery language of his country. After
a long absence he returned, and handed to me a folded
sheet of note paper which I recognized as belonging
to the stationery of the yacht. It bore these words in
English, and in Miss Hemster’s handwriting:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I wish to remain here in seclusion, and I consider it very
impertinent of you to have sought me out. I am perfectly
happy here, which I was not on board the yacht, and all I wish
is to be left alone. When good and ready I will write to the
yacht and to the Nagasaki Hotel. Until that time it is useless
for you to intrude.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This was definite enough, and I turned away angry
with myself for having played the busybody, not knowing
enough to attend to my own affairs. I had intended
to tell the young woman of the accident to the
yacht, making that in some way the excuse for my
visit; but in the face of such a message I forgot all
about the information I desired to impart, and so returned
in a huff to Nagasaki. This message set at rest
all thoughts of kidnapping, although it left my honoured
friend Hun Woe’s precipitate departure as much
a mystery as ever.</p>

<p>On my arrival at the hotel I showed the note to
Hilda, who averred there could be no doubt about its
genuineness, and she asked my permission to give it to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Mr. Hemster to allay his rapidly arising anxiety, which
mission it certainly performed as completely as it had
snubbed me.</p>

<p>Next day the yacht was floated and appeared none
the worse for the collision. The captain took her out
to the anchorage, and so we waited several days to hear
from the girl, but no word came. Finally her father
wrote a letter to her, beseeching some indication of her
plans, and this was sent by messenger to the House of
the Million Blossoms. The old gentleman had become
exceedingly tired of Nagasaki, and very evidently did
not know what to do with himself. The messenger returned,
but brought no answer. He said the man at
the gate had taken in the letter, and brought out the
verbal message that the lady would write when she
was ready to do so. This was the reverse of satisfactory,
and Mr. Hemster roamed about disconsolately
like a lost spirit. Hilda said he told her that his daughter
had never before remained in the same mind for
two days together, and this prolonged country house
visit caused him great uneasiness. He now became infused
with the kidnapping idea, not fearing that she
had been taken away to Corea, but believing that the
Japanese were holding her prisoner, perhaps with the
idea of a ransom later on. Finally Mr. Hemster determined
to visit the House of the Million Blossoms himself,
and he insisted on Hilda’s accompanying us, which
she did with some reluctance. Never did she believe
that this was other than one of the girl’s prolonged
caprices to make us all anxious, hoping to laugh at us
later on for being so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>At the gateway we were met by the same imperturbable
guardian, who was as obdurate as ever. He
would take in any message, he said, but would not permit
us to enter even the grounds. Mr. Hemster sent
a letter he had written at the hotel, and in due time the
keeper came out with a signed note, somewhat similar
to the one I had received. It said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>:</p>

<p>“Do not worry about me; I am perfectly happy and wish to
remain here a few days longer.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l6">“Your affectionate daughter,</span><br />
“G.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>After reading this he passed it on to Hilda and me in
silence. He got into his ’rickshaw without a word,
and we entered ours. The men tottered along until we
were out of sight of the lodge, and then Mr. Hemster
called a halt. He sprang out, and, approaching me,
said:</p>

<p>“Well, Tremorne, what do you make of it?”</p>

<p>The voice in which his question was put quivered
with anguish, and, glancing at his face, I saw it drawn
and haggard with an expression that betokened terror.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s nothing to make of it, Mr. Hemster,
except that the young lady, for some reason unknown
to me, desires to make you anxious and has succeeded.”</p>

<p>“Tremorne,” he said, unheeding this attempted consolation,
“look at this note. It was not written to-day,
but weeks ago. It was written on board the yacht, and
so was the one you received, although I did not notice
that at the time. This was written with a stub pen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
the same that she used in sending me the first letter;
but this pen she did not take away with her, nor the
ink. My poor girl has been deluded into writing those
letters by some one who had a subtle end to serve. I
cannot fathom the mystery, but I am certain she is not
in that house.”</p>

<p>I sprang down from my ’rickshaw.</p>

<p>“I’ll soon settle that point,” I cried, “I will crush
through the boundary hedge, and break in the door of
the house. If there are any ladies within they will
soon make an outcry, which will reveal their presence.
You wait for me here.”</p>

<p>To this he at once agreed, and with some difficulty
I got into the thick plantation, through which I made
my way until I came to the house, the first look at
which convinced me it was empty. There is something
of desolate loneliness about a deserted house which instantly
strikes a beholder.</p>

<p>There was no need for me to break in, for one of the
windows was open, and, tip-toeing up on the broad
veranda, so that there would be no chance of the
custodian hearing me, I entered a room through this
window, and the whole silent house was at my disposal.</p>

<p>The interior would have struck a European unacquainted
with Japan as being unfurnished, but I saw
that it remained just as the Countess had left it. On a
small table, standing about a foot from the floor, I saw
a note similar to the one that had been handed to me
when I first inquired at the gate, also three long slips
of Japanese paper on which were written instructions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
in the Japanese language. I read them with amazement.
The first said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This letter is to be given to a young man who calls, and
who speaks Japanese and English.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On the next slip:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This letter is to be given to an old man who speaks nothing
but English.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The third slip bore:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“This is to be given to a young woman who speaks nothing
but English.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There was also a minute description of Mr. Hemster,
Miss Stretton, and myself, so that the man at the
gate could make no mistake, which indeed he had not
done. Hilda had not asked for a letter, therefore the
remaining note had not been delivered.</p>

<p>Whoever concocted the plot had expected a search
to be made for the House of the Million Blossoms, and
of course knew that its situation could easily be found.
I put all the documents into my pocket, and now went
out by the public exit, greatly to the amazement of my
urbane friend at the gate. I fear I may be accused of
adopting Western methods, but the occasion seemed to
me too serious for dilly-dallying. I pulled Mr. Hemster’s
revolver from my pocket and pointed it at the
man’s head.</p>

<p>“Now, you scoundrel,” I said in his own tongue,
“when did those women leave here? Answer me
truly, or I shall take you prisoner to Nagasaki, where
you will have to face the authorities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>I showed him the written instructions I had captured
inside the house, and he saw at once that the
game was up.</p>

<p>“Excellency!” said he, still politely enough, “I am
but a poor man and a hireling. Many days ago a messenger
brought me these instructions and three letters.
No lady has been in this house for some years; the instructions
were written by my mistress, the Countess,
and I was compelled to follow them.”</p>

<p>I saw that the man spoke the truth, and proceeded to
cross-examine him on the motives which he imagined
actuated this extraordinary complication; but he had
told me all he knew, and was apparently as much in the
dark regarding the motive as I was myself. I left
him there, and hurried along the road over the hill to
the spot where I had left Mr. Hemster and Hilda.
Here I explained the conspiracy so far as I had discovered
it, but the record of my investigation naturally
did nothing to calm the fears of my employer, whose
shrewdness had given a clue to the real situation at the
House of the Million Blossoms. There was nothing
to do but get back to Nagasaki as speedily as possible,
and lay the case before the authorities. Hemster
seemed suddenly to have become in truth an old man.
We went directly to the hotel, and the clerk met us in
the passage-way.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hemster,” he said, “this telegram came for
you about two hours ago.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman tore open the envelope, read the
dispatch, then crushed the paper in his hand.</p>

<p>“Just as I thought,” he said. “She is in Seoul and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
has found some way of communicating with me. Poor
little girl, poor little girl.”</p>

<p>The father’s voice broke momentarily, but he at once
pulled himself together again.</p>

<p>“Tremorne, tell the captain to get the yacht under
way. We will go on board immediately. We shall
want an escort from Chemulpo to Seoul; can we depend
on getting them at the port as we did before, or
had we better bring them from Nagasaki?”</p>

<p>“I think, sir,” said I, “that it would be well to take
a dozen from here. They are men I can trust, and I
shall have them aboard the yacht before steam is up.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, decisively, “see to it.”</p>

<p>I sent a messenger to the captain, then devoted all
my energies to the selecting of my twelve men, taking
care that they were properly armed and provided with
rations. I sent them aboard one by one or two by two
in sampans, so that too much attention might not be
attracted toward our expedition.</p>

<p>This task accomplished, I hurried back to the hotel,
and found Mr. Hemster and Hilda waiting for me.
Cammerford was there also, talking in a low voice very
earnestly with the old gentleman, who stood with his
eyes bent on the ground, making no reply to the other’s
expostulations beyond shaking his head now and then.
Hilda and I went on ahead to the landing, the two men
following us. To my surprise Cammerford stepped
into the launch and continued talking to the silent man
beside him. When we reached the yacht Mr. Hemster
without a word mounted the steps to the deck. Hilda
followed, and Cammerford stood in the launch, a puzzled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
expression on his face. After a momentary hesitation
he pushed past me, and ran up the steps. I also
went on deck, and by the time I reached there my chief
was already in his wicker chair with his feet on the rail,
and a fresh unlit cigar in his mouth. Cammerford
went jauntily up to him and said with a laugh that
seemed somewhat forced:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Hemster, I propose to continue this discussion
to Corea.”</p>

<p>“Just as you please,” replied the old man nonchalantly.
“I think we can make you very comfortable
on board.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Now</span> it was full speed ahead and a direct line
for Corea. Once in the open sea, we
struck straight through the Archipelago
and took our chances of running down an island, as
the captain had said. There was no dawdling this
time, for the engines were run to the top of their power.
As was the case with our former voyages in these
waters, the weather was perfect and the sea smooth.</p>

<p>Our dinner that night was on the whole a silent festival.
The jovial captain did not come down, and Mr.
Hemster sat moodily at the head of the table, absorbed
in thought and doubtless tortured with anxiety. Cammerford
was the only member of the party who endeavoured
to make a show of cheerful demeanour. His
manner with women was one of deferential urbanity,
and, as he never ventured to joke with them, he was
justly popular with the sex. I quite envied him his
power of pleasing, which was so spontaneous that it
seemed a natural and not an acquired gift. The man
appeared to possess an almost hypnotic power over his
fellow-creatures, and although I believed him to be one
of the most untrustworthy rascals alive, yet I felt this
belief crumbling away under the magnetic charm of
his conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>The old gentleman at the head of the table was
evidently immune so far as Cammerford’s fascination
was concerned. I surmised that there had come a
hitch in the negotiations between them. There was no
trace of uneasiness in Cammerford’s attitude, and his
voice was as mildly confident as ever. No one would
guess that he was practically a self-invited guest at
this board. Our host was completely taciturn, but the
unbidden guest never risked a snub by addressing a
direct question to him, although he airily included Mr.
Hemster with the rest of us within the area of his polite
discourse. Hilda was scarcely more responsive
than Mr. Hemster and seemed troubled because he was
troubled, and as I possessed an instinctive dislike for
Cammerford it will be seen that he had a most difficult
rôle to play, which he enacted with a success that
would have done credit to Sir Henry Irving himself.
If there was indeed, as I suspected, a conflict between
the elder man and the younger, I found myself wondering
which would win, but such a quiet atmosphere of
confidence enwrapped the latter that I began to fear Mr.
Hemster had met his match, in spite of the fact that he
held all the trump cards. Cammerford represented the
new school of financiers, who juggled with billions as
a former generation had played with millions. My
sympathies were entirely with Mr. Hemster, but if I
had been a sporting man my bet would have been laid
on Cammerford. I mention this as an instance of the
hypnotic power I have referred to. I knew that Cammerford
could not form his gigantic trust and leave
Mr. Hemster out; therefore, as I say, the elder man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
held the trumps. Nevertheless the bearing of Cammerford
indicated such reserved assurance that I felt
certain he would ultimately bend the old man to his
will, and I watched for the result of this opposition of
forces with the eagerness with which one awaits the
climax of an exciting play on the stage.</p>

<p>After dinner Hilda came on deck for half an hour
or thereabouts, and we walked up and down together.
The excitement of the day and the uncertainty that lay
ahead of us had told heavily on the poor girl, and I had
not the heart to persuade her to remain longer on deck.
She was rather depressed and admittedly weary of the
life we were leading. So I took cowardly advantage
of this and proposed we should get married at the
American Consulate as soon as the yacht returned to
Nagasaki. Then, I said, we could make our way to
Yokohama and take passage on a regular liner for San
Francisco.</p>

<p>To this proposal she made no reply, but walked demurely
by my side with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>“Think of the glories of Chicago at this moment!”
I cried enthusiastically, wishing to appeal to the home
feeling. “Dinner finished; the roar of the traffic in
the streets; the brilliancy of the electric light; the
theatres open, and the gay crowds entering therein.
Let us make for Chicago.”</p>

<p>She looked up at me with a wan little smile, and
laughed quietly.</p>

<p>“You <em>do</em> need a guardian, as Papa Hemster says.
I suppose it is about noon in Chicago at the present
moment, and I don’t see why the theatres should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
open at that hour. It is the roar of the wheat pit, and
not of the traffic you are hearing. I fear your visit to
Chicago was of the briefest, for your picture is not
very convincing. Still, I confess I wish I were there
now, if you were with me.” Then with a slight sigh
she added, “I’ll accept that guardianship at Nagasaki.
Good-night, my dear,” and with that she whisked away
and disappeared before I was aware of her meditated
escape.</p>

<p>I lit a fresh cigar and continued my promenade
alone. As I walked aft I caught snatches of the musical
monotone of Cammerford’s voice. Ever since dinner
time he had been in earnest conversation with Mr.
Hemster, who sat in his usual chair at the stern of the
boat. So far as I am aware, Mr. Hemster was leaving
the burden of the talk to the younger man, who,
from the tone of his voice, seemed in deadly earnest.
At last Mr. Hemster got up and threw his cigar overboard.
I heard him say:</p>

<p>“I told you, Mr. Cammerford, that I would not discuss
this matter further until I reached Nagasaki. The
papers are all in my desk under lock and key in the
room at the hotel, and that room is closed and sealed.
I’ll say no more about this scheme until I am back
there.”</p>

<p>“And when you are back there, Mr. Hemster, what
action are you going to take?”</p>

<p>“Whatever action seems to be best for my own interests,
Mr. Cammerford.”</p>

<p>“Well, from most men that reply would be very
unsatisfactory. However, I am glad to say I trust you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
completely, Mr. Hemster, and I know you will do the
square thing in the end.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you think so,” said the old man curtly,
as he went down the stairway. Cammerford stood
there for a few moments, then strode forward and
joined me.</p>

<p>“May I beg a light of you?” he asked, as if he were
conferring a favour.</p>

<p>I don’t care to light one cigar from another, so I
struck a match and held it while he took advantage of
the flame.</p>

<p>“Thanks. Now, Tremorne, I want to talk with
you as to a friend. We were friends once, you
know.”</p>

<p>“True; the kind of friend the celebrated phrase
refers to, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“What phrase?”</p>

<p>“‘God protect me from my friends,’ or words to that
effect.”</p>

<p>He laughed most genially.</p>

<p>“That’s one on me,” he said. “However, I look
on our score as being wiped out. Can’t you let bygones
be bygones?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“You see you are in a way responsible. I have
turned over the money to you. Granted I was forced
to do so. I claim no merit in the matter, but I do say
a bargain is a bargain. I showed you the old man’s
letter to me, in which he said if I did thus and so by
you, he would join me in the big beef combine. You
remember that, don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>“Naturally, I shouldn’t soon forget it, or forget the
generosity of Mr. Hemster in writing it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, generosity is cheap when you are doing it at
somebody else’s expense. Still, I don’t complain of that
at all. What I say is this: I’ve kept my part of the
contract strictly and honestly, but now the old man is
trying to euchre me.”</p>

<p>“I remember also, Mr. Cammerford, that you said
Mr. Hemster was a rogue or dishonest, or something
of like effect.”</p>

<p>“Well, so he is.”</p>

<p>“In that case, why do you object to being euchred
by him?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I had his promise in writing, and I
thought I was safe.”</p>

<p>“You have it in writing still, I presume. If he does
not live up to what he has written, you probably have
your recourse at law, for they say there is no wrong
without a remedy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all talking through your hat. It isn’t
a lawsuit I’m after, but the co-operation of Mr. Hemster.
What chance would I have against a man of his
wealth?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. What is it you wish from
me? Advice?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to explain the situation that has arisen,
and I wish to know if you have anything to suggest
that will lead the old man to do the square
thing?”</p>

<p>“I have no suggestion to make, Mr. Cammerford.”</p>

<p>“Supposing he does not keep his promise, don’t you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
think it would be fair that the money I expended on the
strength of it should be returned to me?”</p>

<p>“It does seem reasonable, I admit.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear you say so, and to tell the truth,
Mr. Tremorne, it is just the action I should expect of
you.”</p>

<p>“What action?”</p>

<p>“The returning of the money, of course.”</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, you don’t suppose I’m going to
return a penny of it, do you?”</p>

<p>“Ah, your honesty is theory then, not practice.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, my honesty is both theory and practice.
The money is mine. I made you no promises
regarding it. In fact, I refused to make any promise
when you offered me half the amount. If I had made
any engagements I should have kept them.”</p>

<p>“I see. I take it then you do not regard yourself
as bound by any promises the old man made on your
behalf?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. I knew nothing of the matter until
you showed me his letter.”</p>

<p>“Your position is perfectly sound, Mr. Tremorne,
and I unreservedly withdraw the imputation I put upon
your honesty a moment since. But the truth is that
this amount represents a very serious loss to me. It was
a sprat thrown out to catch a whale, or, rather, a whale
thrown out to catch a shoal of whales. But if I lose
the whale and do not catch my shoal, then I have done
a very bad piece of business by coming East. Through
this proposed combine I expected to make several millions.
Now, if you will join in with me, and put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
your half-million into the pool, I’ll guarantee that before
a month you have doubled it.”</p>

<p>“You gave me a chance like that once before, Mr.
Cammerford.”</p>

<p>The man laughed heartily as if I had perpetrated a
very amusing joke.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but that was years ago. We have both
learned a good deal since.”</p>

<p>“I certainly have, Mr. Cammerford. I have learned
so much that I will not part with a penny of the money;
not a red cent of it, as we say out West. That sum is
going to be safely salted down, and it’s not going to be
salted in a corned-beef tub either. I don’t mind telling
you that I intend to get married upon it at the American
Consulate at Nagasaki before a week is past.”</p>

<p>“Really? Allow me to congratulate you, my boy.
I surmised that was the way the land lay, and I quite
envy you your charming young lady.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!”</p>

<p>“But you see, Mr. Tremorne, that makes your
money doubly safe. I noticed that Mr. Hemster is as
fond of Miss Stretton as he is of his own daughter,
and if you give me the half million, he’ll see to it that
you make a hundred per cent on it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t at all agree with you, Mr. Cammerford.
To speak with brutal frankness, if I trusted you with
the money which you once succeeded in detaching
from me,&mdash;if I trusted you with it again,&mdash;he would
merely look upon me as a hopeless fool, and I must say
I think he would be right.”</p>

<p>John C. Cammerford was a man whom you couldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
insult: it was not business to take offence, so he took
none, but merely laughed again in his free-hearted
way.</p>

<p>“The old man thinks I don’t see what his game is,
but I do. He is playing for time. He expects to hold
me out here in the East, dangling this bait before me,
until it is too late for me to do anything with my options.
Now, he is going to get left at that game. I
have more cards up my sleeve than he imagines, but
I don’t want to have any trouble with him: I want to
deal with him in a friendly manner for our mutual
benefit. I’ll play fair if he plays fair. It isn’t too
much to ask a man to keep his word, is it!”</p>

<p>“No, the demand doesn’t appear excessive.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Now, I wish you would have a quiet
talk with him. I can see that he reposes great confidence
in you. You have admitted that my request is
an honest one, so I hope you won’t mind just presenting
my side of the case to him.”</p>

<p>“It is none of my business, Mr. Cammerford. I
could not venture to take such a liberty with Mr.
Hemster.”</p>

<p>“But you admit the old man isn’t playing fair?”</p>

<p>“I admit nothing of the sort: I don’t know his
side of the story at all. He may have reasons for declining
to deal with you, which seem to him conclusive.”</p>

<p>“Granted. But nevertheless, don’t you think he
should return the money given on the strength of his
promise?”</p>

<p>“Really I would rather not discuss the matter any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
further, Mr. Cammerford, if you don’t mind. I overheard
you telling him at the head of the companion-way
that you trusted him completely. Very well, then, why
not continue to do so?”</p>

<p>Cammerford gave a short laugh that had little of
mirth in it: his politeness was evidently becoming worn
threadbare, and I imagine he was inwardly cursing
my obstinacy. There was silence between us for several
minutes, then he said sharply:</p>

<p>“Is this yarn about the kidnapping of his daughter
all guff?”</p>

<p>“Who told you about it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, he did: gave that as the reason he didn’t wish
to talk business.”</p>

<p>“The story is true, and I think the reason is valid.
If you take my advice, you will not talk business with
him in the face of his prohibition until his mind is at
rest regarding his daughter.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll take your advice; it seems to be
the only thing I’m going to get out of you. I thought
the daughter story was only a yarn to bluff me from
coming aboard the yacht.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t, and furthermore, I don’t think you
showed your usual perspicacity in not accepting Mr.
Hemster’s intimation that he didn’t want to be bothered
at this particular time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, as to that,” said Cammerford, confidently,
“the old man has been making a monkey of me
for some weeks now, and the whole matter might have
been settled in as many hours if he had cared to do so.
He isn’t going to shake me off so easily as he thinks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
I’ll stick to him till he keeps his promise, and don’t you
forget it.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll endeavour to keep it in mind.”</p>

<p>“You won’t be persuaded to try and lure him on to
the straight and narrow path of honesty, Mr. Tremorne?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not sure that he’s off it. I have always
found him treading that path.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, good-night. When do we reach that
outlandish place,&mdash;whatever its name is?”</p>

<p>“We ought to arrive at Chemulpo some time to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p>“Chemulpo, is it? Well, I wish it was Chicago.
So long.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” I responded, and with that he left the
world to darkness and to me.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> came to anchor a little after ten the next
night. Mr. Hemster was naturally very
impatient, and wished to proceed at once
to the capital, but the customs authorities refused to
let us land until daylight. Cammerford talked very
valiantly of forcing our way ashore and going to Seoul
in the darkness in spite of all opposition, and indeed the
old gentleman was rather in favour of such a course;
but I pointed out that our mission might be one of
great delicacy, and that it was as well not to use force
unless we were compelled to do so.</p>

<p>“Even in New York,” said I, “we should not be
allowed to proceed up the harbour after sunset, no matter
how anxious we might be to land.”</p>

<p>This was not thought to be a parallel case, but the
old gentleman suggested that, as he wished no undue
publicity, it would be better to wait until daylight and
make our landing with as little ostentation as possible.
I tried bribery, but for once it was ineffective, and in
spite of the fact that I incurred the contempt of the
energetic Cammerford, I counselled less hurry and
more speed, though there was nothing to do but turn
in and get a night’s sleep in preparation for the toilsome
journey in the morning.</p>

<p>I was on deck at daylight and found my Japs had all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
disappeared except their leader. He explained to me
that he thought it best to get them ashore during the
night unobtrusively in sampans. They would be
waiting for us, he said, two or three miles beyond the
port on the Seoul road. Now our Excellencies might
disembark, he added, without attracting any attention.
I complimented the little man on his forethought, and,
sure enough, we found our company just where he said
we would.</p>

<p>The next surprise was that Cammerford also had
disappeared. I went down to his stateroom, but found
his bed had not been slept in. The Japs had seen nothing
of him, neither had any of the crew, so our unbidden
guest had departed as he came.</p>

<p>Hilda was evidently most reluctant to take the journey.
She told me she had seen enough of Seoul to
last her a lifetime, but as she found that Mr. Hemster
was most anxious for her to accompany us, she did
what she always had done, and sacrificed her own inclinations
in deference to the wishes of others.</p>

<p>We had got nearly half way to Seoul when I saw
with alarm a large party, apparently of Corean soldiers,
marching westward. They were easily ten to one as
compared with our escort, yet I had not the slightest
doubt our Japs would put them all to flight if they attempted
to bar our way. Taking two of the Japs with
me, I galloped on ahead to learn the intentions of the
cavalcade in front. They paused in their march on
seeing us coming up, and their leader galloped forward
to meet me. To my surprise I saw it was the Prime
Minister himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you old scoundrel,” I cried, “your head is
still on your shoulders unfortunately. What’s the
meaning of this movement of troops. Do you think
you’re going to stop us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Excellency, no. I have come to greet you,
and offer you the profound regard of the Emperor
himself.”</p>

<p>“Now, just try to speak the truth for once; it won’t
hurt you. You know very well that you had no word
of our coming.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, most Gracious Excellency, but your white
ambassador arrived as soon as the gates were open this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Our white ambassador! Oh, that’s Cammerford,
very likely. So he has reached the capital, has
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellency, and has received the honour
due.”</p>

<p>“That ought to be a gorgeous reception. And did
he send you to meet us?”</p>

<p>“No, Excellency, it was the white Princess.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you villain, you did kidnap her after all.
Now if any harm has come to her, off goes your head,
and down goes your pasteboard city.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Excellency,” said the Prime Minister with a
wail of woe, “it was indeed depths of wickedness, but
what was I to do? If I did not bring her to Seoul,
not only was my head lost, but the heads of all my kin;
and now, alas, the Emperor says that if she goes
not willingly away he will yet execute me, and all my
family as well. Excellency, it was an unlucky day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
when the white Princess came to the Palace. The Emperor
is in fear of his life, and terror reigns in every
corner. Yet she would not go until the King, her
father, brought his warship to Chemulpo, and she demanded
to be escorted by the whole court with the
honours of an Empress from the capital to the sea. She
was going to make the Emperor himself come, but he
bowed his forehead in the dust, a thing unknown these
ten thousand years in Corea, and so she laughed at him
and allowed him to remain in the Palace. She has
made a mock of his Majesty and his ancestors.”</p>

<p>“Serves him jolly well right,” said I, beginning to
get an inkling of how the case stood. “Her ancestors
fought for liberty, and it is not likely she is going to be
deprived of hers by any tan-bark monarch who foolishly
undertakes the job. Is the lady still at the Palace,
Hun Woe?”</p>

<p>“No, Excellency, she is on her way hither, escorted
by the Court, and riding proudly with her white ambassador.
Indeed,” he continued, looking over his
shoulder, “I can see them now, coming over the brow
of that hill. She was so anxious to meet her father
that she would not await your coming.”</p>

<p>“All right, Hun Woe, you line up your troops on
each side of the road, and see that they bow low when
the Princess passes. I shall return and acquaint the
King, her father, with the state of the poll.”</p>

<p>So saying I wheeled my horse, galloped back, and
informed the old gentleman that everything was all
right. He heaved a deep sigh of relief, and I fancied
his eyes twinkled somewhat as I related what particulars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
I had gathered of the reign of terror in Seoul since
his daughter’s enforced arrival.</p>

<p>By the time I had finished my recital the cavalcade
to the rear had passed between the lines of prostrate
soldiers. The old gentleman moved forward to meet
his daughter, and she came galloping on her pony and
greeted him with an affectionate abandon that was delightful
to see, although when she flung her arms round
his neck she nearly unhorsed him. Her reception of
the rest of us was like that of a school-girl out on a
lark. She seemed to regard her abduction as the
greatest fun that ever was, and was bubbling with
laughter and glee. She kissed the sedate Hilda as if
she were an only sister, reproaching herself that even
for a moment she had preferred that little beast of a
Countess, as she called her, to so noble a treasure as
Miss Stretton. To me she was as gracious as if I
were her dearest friend.</p>

<p>“And now, Poppa,” she cried, “shall I make this
circus come with us to Chemulpo? I can do what I
please with them; they belong to me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we want that crowd tagging after us,
Gertie,” said her father without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Then, Mr. Tremorne,” she said, “will you order
them home again, and tell ’em to be good for ever after.
And oh! I want you to ask the Prime Minister if I
didn’t make that old Emperor kow-tow to me.”</p>

<p>“He has already admitted that you did, Miss Hemster.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s all right: I thought they’d try to
deny it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>I bade an affectionate farewell to Hun Woe, who
was as glad to be quit of me as I was to be rid of him,
and we have never seen each other since.</p>

<p>I don’t remember ever taking part in a jollier excursion
than that which now set forth towards Chemulpo,
which place we reached before sunset.</p>

<p>Miss Hemster related her adventures with a gusto
and enjoyment that I never saw equalled. Even her
father smiled now and then at the exuberant humour of
her declamation. It seemed that the Countess was in
the pay of the Corean Government, probably as a spy.
The Prime Minister had telegraphed her to win the
confidence of Miss Hemster if she could, and so the
Countess had made application to the American Consul
and succeeded even beyond her fondest hopes. There
had been no intention of going to the House of the Million
Blossoms, but she had proposed instead to Miss
Hemster a round of visits among the nobility of Japan,
or at least whatever section of them lived near Nagasaki.
As this round was to take some time, and as the
Countess proclaimed that it must be done in strict
secrecy, she outlined the writing of the different letters
which her caretaker at the villa would hand to whoever
called, if an investigation was made, as the wily
Countess thought was highly probable, and this scheme
proved peculiarly attractive to Miss Hemster and was
accordingly carried out, and the young lady laughed
till tears came into her eyes when I told her how I had
been deceived by the receipt of my letter.</p>

<p>After landing from the yacht the Countess took Miss
Hemster and her maid to a tea house situated on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
shore of the bay, and from the moment they drank tea
there, Miss Hemster and her maid remembered nothing
more until they found themselves on board the Chinese
steamer.</p>

<p>“Did you know about the attempted sinking of the
yacht?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sure,” she said. “I was in a sort of
daze: I seemed to have awakened when they began to
take up the anchor, but I was stupid and headachy.
Then there came a crash, and I screamed fit to kill, but
those Chinese brutes put us into the cabin, and after
that of course there was no escape. We did not land
at Chemulpo, but somewhere along the coast. It was a
fearful ride into Seoul, but after that I had my revenge;
I made the old Emperor and his Court stand
around, I tell you, for I had a revolver and plenty of
cartridges in my trunk, and once I got them the situation
belonged to me.”</p>

<p>“And where are your trunks, Gertie?” asked her
practical father.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re stored in Chemulpo. The Emperor
wanted me to leave, but I wouldn’t until you came and
I was provided with a proper escort. He wanted me
to go back on the same old Chinese tub, but I told him
I’d a steamer of my own coming.”</p>

<p>We got the trunks and set sail for Nagasaki once
more. The voyage was a dream of delight. Never
did I see Miss Gertrude Hemster, or any one else for
that matter, so admirably charming and considerate of
everyone around her. Mr. Cammerford proved a most
devoted cavalier, and this gave Hilda and me opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
for converse which we did not neglect. Gertrude
Hemster cheered her father’s heart by telling him that
she was tired of king-hunting and wanted to get back
to Chicago. When we arrived at Nagasaki I made
arrangements for our marriage at the American Consulate.
Miss Hemster was most fascinatingly sweet to
Hilda when she heard the news. We all went together
to the consulate, Cammerford asking permission to join
our party. When we arrived, Cammerford, who
seemed to be taking a great deal upon himself, said politely
to the Consul:</p>

<p>“I should think a real American wedding takes
precedence over an international affair, but at any rate
I bespoke your services first.”</p>

<p>The Consul smiled and said such was indeed the
case; then, to the amazement of Hilda and myself,
Gertrude, with a laugh, took the outstretched hand of
John C. Cammerford and stood before the official, who
married them according to the laws of the land to
which they belonged.</p>

<p>“What do you think of this combine, Mr. Hemster?”
said Cammerford with his most engaging smile,
holding out his hand to his newly made father-in-law.</p>

<p>The old man took it and said quietly:</p>

<p>“Whoever makes Gertie happy makes me content.”</p>

<p>Next came the turn of Hilda and myself.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
